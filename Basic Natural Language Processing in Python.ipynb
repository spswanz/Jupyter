      "those countries before him.  I make small pretense of showing anyone how\n",

      "countless firesides.  It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like\n",

      "scale.  The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam\n",
      "ferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up\n",

      "and cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in\n",
      "many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history! They were to\n",
      "sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean;\n",
      "they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shouts\n",
      "and laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks,\n",
      "or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the\n",
      "shark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night\n",
      "they were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a\n",
      "ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the\n",
      "bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the\n",

      "\n",
      "       From Gibraltar, running along the coasts of Spain and France,\n",

      "learned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances, and life in\n",

      "longer half-past six to these pilgrims from New England, the South, and\n",

      "o'clock were “eight bells”; the captain did not take the longitude at\n",
      "nine o'clock, but at “two bells.”  They spoke glibly of the “after\n",

      "At seven bells the first gong rang; at eight there was breakfast, for\n",
      "such as were not too seasick to eat it.  After that all the well people\n",
      "walked arm-in-arm up and down the long promenade deck, enjoying the fine\n",
      "summer mornings, and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselves\n",
      "up in the lee of the paddle-boxes and ate their dismal tea and toast, and\n",
      "looked wretched.  From eleven o'clock until luncheon, and from luncheon\n",
      "until dinner at six in the evening, the employments and amusements were\n",
      "various.  Some reading was done, and much smoking and sewing, though not\n",
      "by the same parties; there were the monsters of the deep to be looked\n",
      "after and wondered at; strange ships had to be scrutinized through\n",
      "opera-glasses, and sage decisions arrived at concerning them; and more\n",
      "than that, everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag was\n",
      "run up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes of\n",
      "those strangers; in the smoking room there were always parties of\n",

      "that delightfully harmless game; and down on the main deck, “for'rard”\n",
      " --for'rard of the chicken-coops and the cattle--we had what was called\n",
      "“horse billiards.”  Horse billiards is a fine game.  It affords good,\n",
      "active exercise, hilarity, and consuming excitement.  It is a mixture of\n",
      "“hop-scotch” and shuffleboard played with a crutch.  A large hop-scotch\n",
      "diagram is marked out on the deck with chalk, and each compartment\n",
      "numbered.  You stand off three or four steps, with some broad wooden\n",
      "disks before you on the deck, and these you send forward with a vigorous\n",
      "thrust of a long crutch.  If a disk stops on a chalk line, it does not\n",
      "count anything.  If it stops in division No. 7, it counts 7; in 5, it\n",
      "counts 5, and so on.  The game is 100, and four can play at a time.  That\n",
      "game would be very simple played on a stationary floor, but with us, to\n",
      "play it well required science.  We had to allow for the reeling of the\n",
      "ship to the right or the left.  Very often one made calculations for a\n",
      "heel to the right and the ship did not go that way.  The consequence was\n",
      "that that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two, and then\n",
      "there was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it rained the passengers had to stay in the house, of course--or at\n",

      "\n",
      "By 7 o'clock in the evening, dinner was about over; an hour's promenade\n",

      "sixty feet long, for prayers.  The unregenerated called this saloon the\n",
      "“Synagogue.”  The devotions consisted only of two hymns from the Plymouth\n",
      "Collection and a short prayer, and seldom occupied more than fifteen\n",
      "minutes.  The hymns were accompanied by parlor-organ music when the sea\n",

      "being lashed to his chair.\n",

      "precariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down\n",

      "performed on board the Quaker City, had more genuine reel about it than\n",
      "any reel I ever saw before, and was as full of interest to the spectator\n",

      "nobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck, and the congregational\n",

      "is only twenty-four hundred miles, but a right pleasant one in the main.\n",
      "True, we had head winds all the time, and several stormy experiences\n",
      "which sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the ship\n",
      "look dismal and deserted--stormy experiences that all will remember who\n",
      "weathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spray\n",
      "that every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept\n",
      "the ship like a thunder-shower; but for the most part we had balmy summer\n",
      "weather and nights that were even finer than the days.  We had the\n",
      "phenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens at\n",
      "the same hour every night.  The reason of this singular conduct on the\n",
      "part of the moon did not occur to us at first, but it did afterward when\n",
      "we reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day because\n",
      "we were going east so fast--we gained just about enough every day to keep\n",
      "along with the moon.  It was becoming an old moon to the friends we had\n",

      "Young Mr. Blucher, who is from the Far West and is on his first voyage,\n",
      "was a good deal worried by the constantly changing “ship time.”  He was\n",
      "proud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly when\n",
      "eight bells struck at noon, but he came to look after a while as if he\n",
      "were losing confidence in it.  Seven days out from New York he came on\n",

      "skips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then, all\n",
      "of a sudden, she lets down.  I've set that old regulator up faster and\n",
      "faster, till I've shoved it clear around, but it don't do any good; she\n",
      "just distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a way\n",
      "that's astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets in\n",
      "about ten minutes ahead of her anyway.  I don't know what to do with her\n",
      "now.  She's doing all she can--she's going her best gait, but it won't\n",
      "save her.  Now, don't you know, there ain't a watch in the ship that's\n",
      "making better time than she is, but what does it signify?  When you hear\n",

      "had said, he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go, and the\n",
      "watch was “on its best gait,” and so nothing was left him but to fold his\n",
      "hands and see the ship beat the race.  We sent him to the captain, and he\n",
      "explained to him the mystery of “ship time” and set his troubled mind at\n",

      "farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and\n",
      "mingled its upper outlines with the clouds.  It was ribbed with sharp,\n",
      "steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there on the\n",

      "We skirted around two-thirds of the island, four miles from shore, and\n",
      "all the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settle\n",

      "groves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea were\n",
      "really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries.  Finally\n",
      "we stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly became a\n",

      "many a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again, and\n",

      "of the group--Fayal (the people there pronounce it Fy-all, and put the\n",
      "accent on the first syllable).  We anchored in the open roadstead of\n",
      "Horta, half a mile from the shore.  The town has eight thousand to ten\n",
      "thousand inhabitants.  Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of\n",
      "fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more\n",
      "attractive.  It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are\n",
      "three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear\n",
      "to their summits--not a foot of soil left idle.  Every farm and every\n",
      "acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty\n",
      "it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that\n",
      "blow there.  These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava\n",
      "walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguese\n",
      "characteristics about it.  But more of that anon.  A swarm of swarthy,\n",
      "noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with\n",
      "brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship's\n",
      "sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore\n",
      "at so much a head, silver coin of any country.  We landed under the walls\n",
      "of a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders,\n",
      "which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever\n",
      "to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to\n",
      "move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find\n",
      "it again when they needed it.  The group on the pier was a rusty one--men\n",
      "and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and\n",
      "unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars.  They\n",
      "trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid\n",
      "of them.  We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these\n",
      "vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment\n",
      "excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back,\n",
      "just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his\n",
      "advertising trip from street to street.  It was very flattering to me to\n",
      "be part of the material for such a sensation.  Here and there in the\n",
      "doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on.  This hood is\n",
      "of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a\n",
      "marvel of ugliness.  It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is\n",
      "unfathomably deep.  It fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head is\n",
      "hidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tin\n",
      "shed in the stage of an opera.  There is no particle of trimming about\n",
      "this monstrous capote, as they call it--it is just a plain, ugly\n",
      "dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of the\n",
      "wind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all.\n",
      "The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will\n",
      "remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its\n",

      "The Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious.  It\n",
      "takes one thousand reis to make a dollar, and all financial estimates are\n",
      "made in reis.  We did not know this until after we had found it out\n",
      "through Blucher.  Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on\n",
      "solid land once more that he wanted to give a feast--said he had heard it\n",

      "I think the Azores must be very little known in America.  Out of our\n",
      "whole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knew\n",
      "anything whatever about them.  Some of the party, well read concerning\n",
      "most other lands, had no other information about the Azores than that\n",
      "they were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic,\n",
      "something more than halfway between New York and Gibraltar.  That was\n",
      "all.  These considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts\n",
      "just here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,\n",
      "shiftless, sleepy, and lazy.  There is a civil governor, appointed by the\n",
      "King of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme\n",
      "control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure.  The islands\n",
      "contain a population of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.\n",
      "Everything is staid and settled, for the country was one hundred years\n",
      "old when Columbus discovered America.  The principal crop is corn, and\n",
      "they raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathers\n",
      "did.  They plow with a board slightly shod with iron; their trifling\n",
      "little harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills grind the\n",
      "corn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to\n",
      "feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from\n",
      "going to sleep.  When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and\n",
      "actually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are\n",
      "in proper position, instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could\n",
      "be moved instead of the mill.  Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after\n",
      "the fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah.  There is not a\n",
      "wheelbarrow in the land--they carry everything on their heads, or on\n",
      "donkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose wheels are solid blocks of\n",
      "wood and whose axles turn with the wheel.  There is not a modern plow in\n",
      "the islands or a threshing machine.  All attempts to introduce them have\n",
      "failed.  The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to\n",
      "shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did\n",
      "before him.  The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I saw\n",
      "no chimneys in the town.  The donkeys and the men, women, and children of\n",
      "a family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged\n",
      "by vermin, and are truly happy.  The people lie, and cheat the stranger,\n",
      "and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their\n",
      "dead.  The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys\n",
      "they eat and sleep with.  The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp\n",
      "are the half a dozen well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the\n",
      "soldiers of the little garrison.  The wages of a laborer are twenty to\n",
      "twenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic about twice as\n",
      "much.  They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar, and this makes\n",
      "them rich and contented.  Fine grapes used to grow in the islands, and an\n",
      "excellent wine was made and exported.  But a disease killed all the vines\n",
      "fifteen years ago, and since that time no wine has been made.  The\n",
      "islands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is necessarily very\n",
      "rich.  Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and two or three\n",
      "crops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported save a\n",
      "few oranges--chiefly to England.  Nobody comes here, and nobody goes\n",
      "away.  News is a thing unknown in Fayal.  A thirst for it is a passion\n",
      "equally unknown.  A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our\n",
      "civil war was over.  Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--or\n",
      "at least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like\n",
      "that!  And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the\n",

      "somebody, but none of us were learned enough to read the story.  The old\n",

      "beside, and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks, and pricked\n",
      "them with their spikes, and shouted something that sounded like\n",

      "itself. These rascals were all on foot, but no matter, they were always\n",

      "But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused\n",

      "About the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon, after landing here,\n",
      "came near finishing that heedless Blucher.  We had just mounted some\n",
      "mules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately,\n",
      "the princely, the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty (may his tribe\n",
      "increase!) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque, with tall tower, rich\n",
      "with checker-work of many-colored porcelain, and every part and portion\n",
      "of the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra, and\n",
      "Blucher started to ride into the open doorway.  A startling “Hi-hi!” from\n",
      "our camp followers and a loud “Halt!” from an English gentleman in the\n",
      "party checked the adventurer, and then we were informed that so dire a\n",
      "profanation is it for a Christian dog to set foot upon the sacred\n",
      "threshold of a Moorish mosque that no amount of purification can ever\n",
      "make it fit for the faithful to pray in again.  Had Blucher succeeded in\n",
      "entering the place, he would no doubt have been chased through the town\n",
      "and stoned; and the time has been, and not many years ago, either, when a\n",
      "Christian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in a\n",
      "mosque.  We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements within\n",
      "and of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains, but even\n",
      "that we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the Moorish\n",
      "bystanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order.\n",
      "The Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since\n",
      "there was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patient\n",
      "as a debilitated clock.  The great men of the city met in solemn conclave\n",
      "to consider how the difficulty was to be met.  They discussed the matter\n",
      "thoroughly but arrived at no solution.  Finally, a patriarch arose and\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, children of the Prophet, it is known unto you that a Portuguee dog\n",
      "of a Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with his\n",
      "presence.  Ye know, also, that when mosques are builded, asses bear the\n",
      "stones and the cement, and cross the sacred threshold.  Now, therefore,\n",
      "send the Christian dog on all fours, and barefoot, into the holy place to\n",
      "mend the clock, and let him go as an ass!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in that way it was done.  Therefore, if Blucher ever sees the inside\n",
      "of a mosque, he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his\n",
      "natural character.  We visited the jail and found Moorish prisoners\n",
      "making mats and baskets.  (This thing of utilizing crime savors of\n",
      "civilization.)  Murder is punished with death.  A short time ago three\n",
      "murderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot.  Moorish guns are\n",
      "not good, and neither are Moorish marksmen.  In this instance they set up\n",
      "the poor criminals at long range, like so many targets, and practiced on\n",
      "them--kept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour before\n",
      "they managed to drive the center.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man steals cattle, they cut off his right hand and left leg and\n",
      "nail them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody.  Their surgery\n",
      "is not artistic.  They slice around the bone a little, then break off the\n",
      "limb.  Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, he\n",
      "don't.  However, the Moorish heart is stout.  The Moors were always\n",
      "brave.  These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince,\n",
      "without a tremor of any kind, without a groan!  No amount of suffering\n",
      "can bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with a\n",
      "cry.\n",

      "Here, marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it.  There\n",
      "are no valentines, no stolen interviews, no riding out, no courting in\n",
      "dim parlors, no lovers' quarrels and reconciliations--no nothing that is\n",
      "proper to approaching matrimony.  The young man takes the girl his father\n",
      "selects for him, marries her, and after that she is unveiled, and he sees\n",
      "her for the first time.  If after due acquaintance she suits him, he\n",
      "retains her; but if he suspects her purity, he bundles her back to her\n",

      "about noon on his Sabbath, as on any other day, removes his shoes at the\n",

      "Mecca.  They go part of the way in English steamers, and the ten or\n",

      "Spain is the only nation the Moors fear.  The reason is that Spain sends\n",

      "while America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a\n",
      "gunboat occasionally.  The Moors, like other savages, learn by what they\n",

      "them their common rights, let alone a favor.  But the moment the Spanish\n",

      "Spain chastised the Moors five or six years ago, about a disputed piece\n",
      "of property opposite Gibraltar, and captured the city of Tetouan.  She\n",
      "compromised on an augmentation of her territory, twenty million dollars'\n",

      "never gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats.\n",
      "They would not compromise as long as the cats held out.  Spaniards are\n",
      "very fond of cats.  On the contrary, the Moors reverence cats as\n",
      "something sacred.  So the Spaniards touched them on a tender point that\n",
      "time.  Their unfeline conduct in eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused a\n",
      "hatred toward them in the breasts of the Moors, to which even the driving\n",
      "them out of Spain was tame and passionless.  Moors and Spaniards are foes\n",
      "forever now.  France had a minister here once who embittered the nation\n",
      "against him in the most innocent way.  He killed a couple of battalions\n",
      "of cats (Tangier is full of them) and made a parlor carpet out of their\n",
      "hides.  He made his carpet in circles--first a circle of old gray\n",
      "tomcats, with their tails all pointing toward the center; then a circle\n",
      "of yellow cats; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones;\n",
      "then a circle of all sorts of cats; and, finally, a centerpiece of\n",

      "Tangier is full of interest for one day, but after that it is a weary\n",

      "two or three more till they wear them out, and after that for days\n",
      "together they eat and drink and sleep, and ride out over the same old\n",
      "road, and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries\n",
      "have scarcely changed, and say never a single word!  They have literally\n",
      "nothing whatever to talk about.  The arrival of an American man-of-war is\n",

      "enough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had another “discrepancy” about him.  He was always wanting us to buy\n",

      "Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on\n",

      "the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter.  His\n",

      "which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into\n",
      "the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then\n",
      "an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did\n",

      "water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician\n",

      "identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love\n",
      "that repulsive object or grieve for its loss.  We grew meditative and\n",
      "wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing\n",
      "was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and\n",
      "displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision\n",
      "of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain.  I half feared that\n",
      "the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we\n",
      "stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred.  Men and women came, and\n",
      "some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others\n",
      "glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look\n",
      "--people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the\n",
      "exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see\n",

      "One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a\n",
      "little while.  We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however,\n",
      "and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment\n",
      "in a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres.  We went to the railroad\n",

      "carriage.  Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but there\n",
      "was no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism.  Some of the women and young\n",

      "we were not at all sure about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and\n",
      "becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked.  When we arrived at\n",
      "the garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a\n",
      "place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving\n",
      "rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower\n",
      "convenient for eating ice cream in.  We moved along the sinuous gravel\n",
      "walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a\n",
      "domed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again\n",
      "with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun.  Nearby was a\n",
      "large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way,\n",
      "and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” I said.  “How is this?”  It nearly took my breath away.\n",

      "Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the\n",

      "temple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking.  The dancing had not begun\n",
      "yet.  Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition.  The famous Blondin\n",
      "was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden.  We\n",
      "went thither.  Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were\n",
      "pretty closely packed together.  And now I made a mistake which any\n",
      "donkey might make, but a sensible man never.  I committed an error which\n",

      "The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple.  Within it was a\n",

      "forward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again,\n",
      "grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised them\n",
      "pretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity and\n",
      "exposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then, drawing her\n",
      "clothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched a\n",

      "That is the can-can.  The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily,\n",

      "\n",
      "Heloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago.  She may have had\n",
      "parents.  There is no telling.  She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canon\n",
      "of the cathedral of Paris.  I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is,\n",
      "but that is what he was.  He was nothing more than a sort of a mountain\n",
      "howitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days.\n",
      "Suffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was\n",
      "happy.  She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil\n",
      "--never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a\n",
      "place.  She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as\n",
      "the case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was\n",
      "the language of literature and polite society at that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widely\n",
      "famous as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris.\n",
      "The originality of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physical\n",
      "strength and beauty created a profound sensation.  He saw Heloise, and\n",
      "was captivated by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charming\n",
      "disposition.  He wrote to her; she answered.  He wrote again; she\n",
      "answered again.  He was now in love.  He longed to know her--to speak to\n",
      "her face to face.\n",
      "\n",
      "His school was near Fulbert's house.  He asked Fulbert to allow him to\n",
      "call.  The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whom\n",
      "he so much loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would not\n",
      "cost him a cent.  Such was Fulbert--penurious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which is\n",
      "unfortunate.  However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well as\n",
      "any other.  We will let him go at that.  He asked Abelard to teach her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abelard was glad enough of the opportunity.  He came often and staid\n",
      "long.  A letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came\n",
      "under that friendly roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with the\n",
      "deliberate intention of debauching a confiding, innocent girl.  This is\n",

      "          “I cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert;\n",
      "          I was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power\n",
      "          of a hungry wolf.  Heloise and I, under pretext of study, gave\n",
      "          ourselves up wholly to love, and the solitude that love seeks\n",
      "          our studies procured for us.  Books were open before us, but we\n",

      "--but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be kept secret\n",

      "off by the police and imprisoned until the following morning.  The next\n",
      "night the British boys came again to renew the fight, but our men had had\n",

      "They said that half of it--from the front door halfway down to the altar\n",
      "--was a Jewish synagogue before the Saviour was born, and that no\n",
      "alteration had been made in it since that time.  We doubted the\n",

      "sitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery, and whose deep ravines\n",
      "were cool and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and the\n",
      "birds were winging our flight through the sultry upper air.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration,\n",
      "though.  We timed one of them.  We were twenty minutes passing through\n",

      "\n",
      "Beyond Alessandria we passed the battle-field of Marengo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and the\n",
      "blue mountain peaks beyond.  But we were not caring for these things\n",
      "--they did not interest us in the least.  We were in a fever of impatience;\n",
      "we were dying to see the renowned cathedral!  We watched--in this\n",
      "direction and that--all around--everywhere.  We needed no one to point it\n",
      "out--we did not wish any one to point it out--we would recognize it even\n",
      "in the desert of the great Sahara.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the amber sunlight,\n",
      "rose slowly above the pygmy housetops, as one sometimes sees, in the far\n",

      "Half of that night, and all of the next day, this architectural autocrat\n",
      "was our sole object of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a wonder it is!  So grand, so solemn, so vast!  And yet so delicate,\n",
      "so airy, so graceful!  A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems in\n",
      "the soft moonlight only a fairy delusion of frost-work that might vanish\n",
      "with a breath!  How sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of\n",
      "spires were cut against the sky, and how richly their shadows fell upon\n",
      "its snowy roof!  It was a vision!--a miracle!--an anthem sung in stone, a\n",
      "poem wrought in marble!\n",
      "\n",
      "Howsoever you look at the great cathedral, it is noble, it is beautiful!\n",

      "Leave your eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and they\n",
      "will surely turn to seek it.  It is the first thing you look for when you\n",

      "ingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living\n",
      "creatures--and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex that\n",
      "one might study it a week without exhausting its interest.  On the great\n",
      "steeple--surmounting the myriad of spires--inside of the spires--over the\n",
      "doors, the windows--in nooks and corners--every where that a niche or a\n",
      "perch can be found about the enormous building, from summit to base,\n",
      "there is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in itself!\n",
      "Raphael, Angelo, Canova--giants like these gave birth to the designs, and\n",
      "their own pupils carved them.  Every face is eloquent with expression,\n",
      "and every attitude is full of grace.  Away above, on the lofty roof, rank\n",
      "on rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and through\n",
      "their rich tracery one sees the sky beyond.  In their midst the central\n",
      "steeple towers proudly up like the mainmast of some great Indiaman among\n",
      "a fleet of coasters.\n",

      "We wished to go aloft.  The sacristan showed us a marble stairway (of\n",
      "course it was marble, and of the purest and whitest--there is no other\n",
      "stone, no brick, no wood, among its building materials) and told us to go\n",
      "up one hundred and eighty-two steps and stop till he came.  It was not\n",
      "necessary to say stop--we should have done that any how.  We were tired\n",
      "by the time we got there.  This was the roof.  Here, springing from its\n",
      "broad marble flagstones, were the long files of spires, looking very tall\n",
      "close at hand, but diminishing in the distance like the pipes of an\n",
      "organ.  We could see now that the statue on the top of each was the size\n",
      "of a large man, though they all looked like dolls from the street.  We\n",
      "could see, also, that from the inside of each and every one of these\n",
      "hollow spires, from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues looked\n",
      "out upon the world below.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless succession\n",
      "great curved marble beams, like the fore-and-aft braces of a steamboat,\n",
      "and along each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carved\n",
      "flowers and fruits--each separate and distinct in kind, and over 15,000\n",
      "species represented.  At a little distance these rows seem to close\n",
      "together like the ties of a railroad track, and then the mingling\n",
      "together of the buds and blossoms of this marble garden forms a picture\n",
      "that is very charming to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "We descended and entered.  Within the church, long rows of fluted\n",
      "columns, like huge monuments, divided the building into broad aisles, and\n",
      "on the figured pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windows\n",
      "above.  I knew the church was very large, but I could not fully\n",
      "appreciate its great size until I noticed that the men standing far down\n",
      "by the altar looked like boys, and seemed to glide, rather than walk.  We\n",
      "loitered about gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow with\n",
      "brilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the Saviour and his followers.\n",
      "Some of these pictures are mosaics, and so artistically are their\n",
      "thousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together that the work\n",
      "has all the smoothness and finish of a painting.  We counted sixty panes\n",
      "of glass in one window, and each pane was adorned with one of these\n",
      "master achievements of genius and patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was\n",
      "considered to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it was not\n",
      "possible that any other artist, of any epoch, could have copied nature\n",
      "with such faultless accuracy.  The figure was that of a man without a\n",
      "skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissue\n",
      "of the human frame represented in minute detail.  It looked natural,\n",
      "because somehow it looked as if it were in pain.  A skinned man would be\n",
      "likely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with some\n",
      "other matter.  It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination\n",
      "about it some where.  I am very sorry I saw it, because I shall always\n",
      "see it now.  I shall dream of it sometimes.  I shall dream that it is\n",
      "resting its corded arms on the bed's head and looking down on me with its\n",
      "dead eyes; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with me\n",
      "and touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard to forget repulsive things.  I remember yet how I ran off from\n",
      "school once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded\n",
      "to climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge,\n",
      "because I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed.  As I lay\n",
      "on the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I\n",
      "could see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor.  A\n",
      "cold shiver went through me.  I turned my face to the wall.  That did not\n",
      "answer.  I was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me in\n",
      "the dark.  I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes--they\n",
      "seemed hours.  It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, never\n",
      "would get to it.  I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the\n",
      "feverish time away.  I looked--the pale square was nearer.  I turned\n",
      "again and counted fifty--it was almost touching it.  With desperate will\n",
      "I turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a\n",
      "tremble.  A white human hand lay in the moonlight!  Such an awful sinking\n",
      "at the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath!  I felt--I cannot tell what\n",
      "I felt.  When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again.  But\n",
      "no boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him.  I\n",
      "counted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was exposed.  I put my\n",
      "hands over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then\n",
      "--the pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn\n",
      "down, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death!  I raised to a sitting\n",
      "posture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the bare\n",
      "breastline by line--inch by inch--past the nipple--and then it disclosed\n",
      "a ghastly stab!\n",
      "\n",
      "I went away from there.  I do not say that I went away in any sort of a\n",
      "hurry, but I simply went--that is sufficient.  I went out at the window,\n",
      "and I carried the sash along with me.  I did not need the sash, but it\n",
      "was handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it.--I was\n",
      "not scared, but I was considerably agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it.  It seemed\n",
      "perfectly delightful.  That man had been stabbed near the office that\n",
      "afternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only lived\n",
      "an hour.  I have slept in the same room with him often since then--in my\n",

      "man whose whole life was given to succoring the poor, encouraging the\n",
      "faint-hearted, visiting the sick; in relieving distress, whenever and\n",
      "wherever he found it.  His heart, his hand, and his purse were always\n",
      "open.  With his story in one's mind he can almost see his benignant\n",

      "when the plague swept the city, brave where all others were cowards, full\n",
      "of compassion where pity had been crushed out of all other breasts by the\n",

      "with all, helping all, with hand and brain and purse, at a time when\n",

      "walls were faced with bas-reliefs representing scenes in his life done in\n",
      "massive silver.  The priest put on a short white lace garment over his\n",
      "black robe, crossed himself, bowed reverently, and began to turn a\n",
      "windlass slowly.  The sarcophagus separated in two parts, lengthwise, and\n",

      "as the atmosphere.  Within lay the body, robed in costly habiliments\n",
      "covered with gold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems.  The\n",
      "decaying head was black with age, the dry skin was drawn tight to the\n",
      "bones, the eyes were gone, there was a hole in the temple and another in\n",
      "the cheek, and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly smile!  Over\n",
      "this dreadful face, its dust and decay and its mocking grin, hung a crown\n",
      "sown thick with flashing brilliants; and upon the breast lay crosses and\n",

      "in proportion.  It was an Aladdin's palace.  The treasures here, by\n",

      "building is five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide, and\n",
      "the principal steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high.\n",
      "It has 7,148 marble statues, and will have upwards of three thousand more\n",

      "bas-reliefs.  It has one hundred and thirty-six spires--twenty-one more\n",
      "are to be added.  Each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a half\n",
      "feet high.  Every thing about the church is marble, and all from the\n",
      "same quarry; it was bequeathed to the Archbishopric for this purpose\n",
      "centuries ago.  So nothing but the mere workmanship costs; still that is\n",
      "expensive--the bill foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions of\n",
      "francs thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars,) and\n",
      "it is estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to\n",

      "years to work out the plan and get it ready to hand over to the\n",

      "towering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right,\n",
      "and every now and then it rained on us.  Just before starting, the driver\n",

      "other--a rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by\n",
      "the road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were curiosities in\n",

      "out of their senses, I should think.  There were some unique auxiliaries\n",
      "to the painting which added to its spirited effect.  These were genuine\n",
      "wooden and iron implements, and were prominently disposed round about the\n",
      "figure: a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the sponge; the reed\n",
      "that supported it; the cup of vinegar; the ladder for the ascent of the\n",

      "thither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys;\n",
      "ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves.\n",
      "There was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a\n",
      "hush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret\n",
      "enterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half\n",
      "in mysterious shadows, the grim old mansions of the Republic seemed to\n",
      "have an expression about them of having an eye out for just such\n",
      "enterprises as these at that same moment.  Music came floating over the\n",
      "waters--Venice was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful.  But what\n",
      "was this Venice to compare with the Venice of midnight?  Nothing.  There\n",
      "was a fete--a grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumental\n",
      "in checking the cholera three hundred years ago, and all Venice was\n",
      "abroad on the water.  It was no common affair, for the Venetians did not\n",
      "know how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that the\n",
      "cholera was spreading every where.  So in one vast space--say a third of\n",
      "a mile wide and two miles long--were collected two thousand gondolas, and\n",
      "every one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty colored\n",
      "lanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants.  Just as\n",
      "far as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed together\n",
      "--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers, except that these blossoms\n",
      "were never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling\n",
      "together, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy\n",
      "evolutions.  Here and there a strong red, green, or blue glare from a\n",
      "rocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly illuminated all the\n",
      "boats around it.  Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and\n",
      "pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up the\n",
      "faces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture;\n",
      "and the reflections of those lights, so long, so slender, so numberless,\n",
      "so many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picture\n",
      "likewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful.  Many and many a party\n",
      "of young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely\n",
      "decorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed,\n",
      "white-cravatted varlets to wait upon them, and having their tables\n",
      "tricked out as if for a bridal supper.  They had brought along the\n",
      "costly globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silken\n",
      "curtains from the same places, I suppose.  And they had also brought\n",
      "pianos and guitars, and they played and sang operas, while the plebeian\n",
      "paper-lanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded\n",
      "around to stare and listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was music every where--choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,\n",
      "every thing.  I was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificence\n",
      "and loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and\n",
      "sang one tune myself.  However, when I observed that the other gondolas\n",
      "had sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I\n",
      "stopped.\n",

      "worth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the theatre, or to the\n",

      "Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them,\n",
      "and packed them in vessels filled with lard.  The religion of Mahomet\n",
      "causes its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork, and\n",
      "so when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of the\n",
      "city, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned up\n",
      "their noses at the unholy lard, and let him go.  The bones were buried in\n",
      "the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years to\n",
      "receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were\n",

      "high, with two slight crooks or curves in one side of it and one in the\n",

      "fill, shoot straight ahead, or flirt suddenly around a corner, and make\n",
      "the oar stay in those insignificant notches, is a problem to me and a\n",
      "never diminishing matter of interest.  I am afraid I study the\n",

      "We learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was a\n",

      "art.  The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the other\n",
      "great names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then it\n",
      "partially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and these\n",
      "shabby pictures were the work of their hands.  Then I said, in my heat,\n",
      "that I “wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years\n",
      "sooner.”  The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to say\n",

      "have such palatial railroad depots and such marvels of turnpikes.  Why,\n",
      "these latter are as hard as adamant, as straight as a line, as smooth as\n",
      "a floor, and as white as snow.  When it is too dark to see any other\n",

      "they are clean enough to eat from, without a table-cloth.  And yet no\n",
      "tolls are charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the railways--we have none like them.  The cars slide as smoothly\n",
      "along as if they were on runners.  The depots are vast palaces of cut\n",
      "marble, with stately colonnades of the same royal stone traversing them\n",
      "from end to end, and with ample walls and ceilings richly decorated with\n",
      "frescoes.  The lofty gateways are graced with statues, and the broad\n",
      "floors are all laid in polished flags of marble.\n",

      "wherewithal to back up his projects; they strengthen France and never\n",
      "weaken her.  Her material prosperity is genuine.  But here the case is\n",
      "different.  This country is bankrupt.  There is no real foundation for\n",
      "these great works.  The prosperity they would seem to indicate is a\n",
      "pretence.  There is no money in the treasury, and so they enfeeble her\n",
      "instead of strengthening.  Italy has achieved the dearest wish of her\n",
      "heart and become an independent State--and in so doing she has drawn an\n",
      "elephant in the political lottery.  She has nothing to feed it on.\n",
      "Inexperienced in government, she plunged into all manner of useless\n",
      "expenditure, and swamped her treasury almost in a day.  She squandered\n",
      "millions of francs on a navy which she did not need, and the first time\n",

      "that would have appalled the stoutest of her statesmen under less\n",
      "desperate circumstances.  They, in a manner, confiscated the domains of\n",
      "the Church!  This in priest-ridden Italy!  This in a land which has\n",

      "drove her to break from this prison-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do not call it confiscating the church property.  That would sound\n",
      "too harshly yet.  But it amounts to that.  There are thousands of\n",
      "churches in Italy, each with untold millions of treasures stored away in\n",
      "its closets, and each with its battalion of priests to be supported.\n",
      "And then there are the estates of the Church--league on league of the\n",

      "--none but the riches of the Church.  So the Government intends to take to\n",
      "itself a great portion of the revenues arising from priestly farms,\n",
      "factories, etc., and also intends to take possession of the churches and\n",
      "carry them on, after its own fashion and upon its own responsibility.\n",
      "In a few instances it will leave the establishments of great pet churches\n",
      "undisturbed, but in all others only a handful of priests will be retained\n",
      "to preach and pray, a few will be pensioned, and the balance turned\n",

      "today, a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants, there are twelve hundred\n",
      "priests.  Heaven only knows how many there were before the Parliament\n",
      "reduced their numbers.  There was the great Jesuit Church.  Under the old\n",

      "with five, now, and the others are discharged from service.  All about\n",
      "that church wretchedness and poverty abound.  At its door a dozen hats\n",
      "and bonnets were doffed to us, as many heads were humbly bowed, and as\n",
      "many hands extended, appealing for pennies--appealing with foreign words\n",
      "we could not understand, but appealing mutely, with sad eyes, and sunken\n",
      "cheeks, and ragged raiment, that no words were needed to translate.  Then\n",
      "we passed within the great doors, and it seemed that the riches of the\n",
      "world were before us!  Huge columns carved out of single masses of\n",
      "marble, and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundred intricate figures\n",
      "wrought in costly verde antique; pulpits of the same rich materials,\n",
      "whose draperies hung down in many a pictured fold, the stony fabric\n",
      "counterfeiting the delicate work of the loom; the grand altar brilliant\n",
      "with polished facings and balustrades of oriental agate, jasper, verde\n",
      "antique, and other precious stones, whose names, even, we seldom hear\n",
      "--and slabs of priceless lapis lazuli lavished every where as recklessly as\n",
      "if the church had owned a quarry of it.  In the midst of all this\n",
      "magnificence, the solid gold and silver furniture of the altar seemed\n",
      "cheap and trivial.  Even the floors and ceilings cost a princely fortune.\n",

      "blasphemous, but it is true, and here they act blasphemy.  The dead and\n",
      "damned Medicis who cruelly tyrannized over Florence and were her curse\n",
      "for over two hundred years, are salted away in a circle of costly vaults,\n",
      "and in their midst the Holy Sepulchre was to have been set up.  The\n",
      "expedition sent to Jerusalem to seize it got into trouble and could not\n",
      "accomplish the burglary, and so the centre of the mausoleum is vacant\n",
      "now.  They say the entire mausoleum was intended for the Holy Sepulchre,\n",
      "and was only turned into a family burying place after the Jerusalem\n",
      "expedition failed--but you will excuse me.  Some of those Medicis would\n",

      "above the ground, and therefore about a hundred or may be a hundred and\n",
      "twenty-five feet higher than the dome of the capitol.--Thus I had one\n",

      "\n",
      "When we reached the door, and stood fairly within the church, it was\n",
      "impossible to comprehend that it was a very large building.  I had to\n",

      "similes.  St. Peter's is bulky.  Its height and size would represent two\n",

      "were wider; or two blocks or two blocks and a half of ordinary buildings\n",
      "set one on top of the other.  St. Peter's was that large, but it could\n",
      "and would not look so.  The trouble was that every thing in it and about\n",
      "it was on such a scale of uniform vastness that there were no contrasts\n",
      "to judge by--none but the people, and I had not noticed them.  They were\n",
      "insects.  The statues of children holding vases of holy water were\n",
      "immense, according to the tables of figures, but so was every thing else\n",
      "around them.  The mosaic pictures in the dome were huge, and were made of\n",
      "thousands and thousands of cubes of glass as large as the end of my\n",
      "little finger, but those pictures looked smooth, and gaudy of color, and\n",
      "in good proportion to the dome.  Evidently they would not answer to\n",
      "measure by.  Away down toward the far end of the church (I thought it was\n",
      "really clear at the far end, but discovered afterward that it was in the\n",
      "centre, under the dome,) stood the thing they call the baldacchino--a\n",
      "great bronze pyramidal frame-work like that which upholds a mosquito bar.\n",
      "It only looked like a considerably magnified bedstead--nothing more.  Yet\n",
      "I knew it was a good deal more than half as high as Niagara Falls.  It\n",

      "each were about the width of a very large dwelling-house front, (fifty or\n",
      "sixty feet,) and that they were twice as high as an ordinary three-story\n",

      "two blocks away, has a diminishing effect on them; surrounded by the\n",
      "prodigious pictures and statues, and lost in the vast spaces, they look\n",
      "very much smaller than they would if they stood two blocks away in the\n",
      "open air.  I “averaged” a man as he passed me and watched him as he\n",

      "insignificant school-boy, and then, in the midst of the silent throng of\n",
      "human pigmies gliding about him, I lost him.  The church had lately been\n",
      "decorated, on the occasion of a great ceremony in honor of St. Peter, and\n",
      "men were engaged, now, in removing the flowers and gilt paper from the\n",
      "walls and pillars.  As no ladders could reach the great heights, the men\n",
      "swung themselves down from balustrades and the capitals of pilasters by\n",
      "ropes, to do this work.  The upper gallery which encircles the inner\n",
      "sweep of the dome is two hundred and forty feet above the floor of the\n",
      "church--very few steeples in America could reach up to it.  Visitors\n",
      "always go up there to look down into the church because one gets the best\n",
      "idea of some of the heights and distances from that point.  While we\n",
      "stood on the floor one of the workmen swung loose from that gallery at\n",
      "the end of a long rope.  I had not supposed, before, that a man could\n",
      "look so much like a spider.  He was insignificant in size, and his rope\n",
      "seemed only a thread.  Seeing that he took up so little space, I could\n",
      "believe the story, then, that ten thousand troops went to St. Peter's,\n",
      "once, to hear mass, and their commanding officer came afterward, and not\n",
      "finding them, supposed they had not yet arrived.  But they were in the\n",
      "church, nevertheless--they were in one of the transepts.  Nearly fifty\n",
      "thousand persons assembled in St. Peter's to hear the publishing of the\n",
      "dogma of the Immaculate Conception.  It is estimated that the floor of\n",
      "the church affords standing room for--for a large number of people; I\n",

      "enough.\n",

      "They have twelve small pillars, in St. Peter's, which came from Solomon's\n",

      "of the true cross, and some nails, and a part of the crown of thorns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course we ascended to the summit of the dome, and of course we also\n",
      "went up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was room\n",
      "there for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as close\n",
      "and hot as an oven.  Some of those people who are so fond of writing\n",
      "their names in prominent places had been there before us--a million or\n",
      "two, I should think.  From the dome of St. Peter's one can see every\n",

      "days of old” when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invading\n",

      "toward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of\n",
      "the olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily\n",
      "festooned with vines.  He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, the\n",

      "varied, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history\n",
      "than any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of a\n",
      "city that once had a population of four million souls; and among its\n",

      "much as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperors\n",

      "of the earth.  We can not see the long array of chariots and mail-clad\n",

      "the building which was once the Inquisition.  How times changed, between\n",
      "the older ages and the new!  Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago,\n",
      "the ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of the\n",
      "Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show.  It\n",
      "was for a lesson as well.  It was to teach the people to abhor and fear\n",
      "the new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching.  The beasts tore\n",
      "the victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the\n",
      "twinkling of an eye.  But when the Christians came into power, when the\n",
      "holy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the\n",
      "error of their ways by no such means.  No, she put them in this pleasant\n",
      "Inquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so\n",
      "merciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and\n",
      "they did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first by\n",
      "twisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their\n",
      "flesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable\n",
      "in cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by\n",
      "roasting them in public.  They always convinced those barbarians.  The\n",
      "true religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to\n",
      "administer it, is very, very soothing.  It is wonderfully persuasive,\n",
      "also.  There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts\n",
      "and stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition.  One is the\n",

      "people.  It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.\n",

      "sarcophagus.  The dates belong away back in the dawn of the Christian\n",
      "era, of course.  Here, in these holes in the ground, the first Christians\n",
      "sometimes burrowed to escape persecution.  They crawled out at night to\n",
      "get food, but remained under cover in the day time.  The priest told us\n",
      "that St. Sebastian lived under ground for some time while he was being\n",
      "hunted; he went out one day, and the soldiery discovered and shot him to\n",
      "death with arrows.  Five or six of the early Popes--those who reigned\n",
      "about sixteen hundred years ago--held their papal courts and advised with\n",
      "their clergy in the bowels of the earth.  During seventeen years--from\n",

      "thereabouts.  It is very suggestive of the unhealthiness of underground\n",
      "graveyards as places of residence.  One Pope afterward spent his entire\n",
      "pontificate in the catacombs--eight years.  Another was discovered in\n",

      "hundred miles, and their graves number seven millions.  We did not go\n",

      "into Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark stairways, just as\n",
      "you do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overhead\n",
      "and something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of the\n",
      "solid earth, that faintly resembled houses.  But you do nothing the kind.\n",
      "Fully one-half of the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed and\n",
      "thrown open freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows of\n",
      "solidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen hundred\n",
      "years ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their floors,\n",
      "clean-swept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of the\n",
      "labored mosaics that pictured them with the beasts, and birds, and\n",
      "flowers which we copy in perishable carpets to-day; and here are the\n",
      "Venuses, and Bacchuses, and Adonises, making love and getting drunk in\n",
      "many-hued frescoes on the walls of saloon and bed-chamber; and there are\n",
      "the narrow streets and narrower sidewalks, paved with flags of good hard\n",
      "lava, the one deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other with\n",
      "the passing feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and there are\n",
      "the bake-shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the baths, the\n",
      "theatres--all clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting nothing of the\n",
      "nature of a silver mine away down in the bowels of the earth.  The\n",
      "broken pillars lying about, the doorless doorways and the crumbled tops\n",
      "of the wilderness of walls, were wonderfully suggestive of the “burnt\n",
      "district” in one of our cities, and if there had been any charred\n",
      "timbers, shattered windows, heaps of debris, and general blackness and\n",
      "smokiness about the place, the resemblance would have been perfect.  But\n",

      "Christ was born in Bethlehem, and its streets are cleaner a hundred\n",
      "times than ever Pompeiian saw them in her prime.  I know whereof I\n",

      "years at least the pavements were not repaired!--how ruts five and even\n",
      "ten inches deep were worn into the thick flagstones by the\n",
      "chariot-wheels of generations of swindled tax-payers?  And do I not know\n",
      "by these signs that Street Commissioners of Pompeii never attended to\n",

      "cleaned them?  And, besides, is it not the inborn nature of Street\n",
      "Commissioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance?  I wish I\n",

      "could give him a blast.  I speak with feeling on this subject, because I\n",
      "caught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness that came over me\n",
      "when I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes and lava sticking to it,\n",
      "was tempered by the reflection that may be that party was the Street\n",

      "No--Pompeii is no longer a buried city.  It is a city of hundreds and\n",
      "hundreds of roofless houses, and a tangled maze of streets where one\n",

      "tireless watch and ward over the possessions it was powerless to save,\n",
      "and went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the Forum of\n",

      "a noble colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic and\n",
      "Corinthian columns scattered about them.  At the upper end were the\n",
      "vacant seats of the Judges, and behind them we descended into a dungeon\n",

      "Latin, in the olden time, when the owners lived there--and we probably\n",
      "wouldn't have got it.  These people built their houses a good deal alike.\n",
      "The floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of\n",

      "“Beware of the Dog,” and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with no\n",

      "in the midst and the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms;\n",
      "beyond the fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden,\n",
      "dining-room, and so forth and so on.  The floors were all mosaic, the\n",
      "walls were stuccoed, or frescoed, or ornamented with bas-reliefs, and\n",
      "here and there were statues, large and small, and little fish-pools, and\n",
      "cascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret places in the\n",
      "colonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the court, and kept the\n",

      "these works of the first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seems\n",
      "hardly to have existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--and\n",
      "it was curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these old\n",
      "time pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came after\n",
      "them. The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the Laocoon and\n",

      "the earth like Pompeii; but their exact age or who made them can only be\n",
      "conjectured.  But worn, and cracked, without a history, and with the\n",

      "thousands and thousands of human beings once bought and sold, and walked\n",
      "and rode, and made the place resound with the noise and confusion of\n",
      "traffic and pleasure.  They were not lazy.  They hurried in those days.\n",
      "We had evidence of that.  There was a temple on one corner, and it was a\n",

      "the other than to go around--and behold that pathway had been worn deep\n",
      "into the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations of\n",

      "when he was in Genoa a few years ago, a captain of a quarantined ship\n",
      "went in his boat to a departing ship, which was already outside of the\n",

      "authorities imprisoned him three months for it, and then conducted him\n",
      "and his ship fairly to sea, and warned him never to show himself in that\n",
      "port again while he lived.  This kind of conversation did no good,\n",
      "further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantine-breaking\n",
      "expedition, and so we dropped it.  We made the entire circuit of the town\n",
      "without seeing any body but one man, who stared at us curiously, but said\n",
      "nothing, and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors,\n",
      "whom we walked among and never woke--but we woke up dogs enough, in all\n",
      "conscience--we always had one or two barking at our heels, and several\n",

      "preposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how we\n",

      "little rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of the\n",
      "State of Nevada, perhaps.  Part of the way it was covered with small,\n",
      "loose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled.  Another\n",
      "part of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground.  Still another part of\n",
      "it was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome and\n",
      "troublesome, and which we took to be brambles.  The Attic Plain, barring\n",
      "the grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder what\n",
      "it was in Greece's Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the neighborhood of one o'clock in the morning, when we were heated\n",

      "weeds are grape-vines!”  and in five minutes we had a score of bunches of\n",
      "large, white, delicious grapes, and were reaching down for more when a\n",
      "dark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said\n",
      "“Ho!”  And so we left.\n",

      "In ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road, and unlike some\n",
      "others we had stumbled upon at intervals, it led in the right direction.\n",
      "We followed it.  It was broad, and smooth, and white--handsome and in\n",
      "perfect repair, and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with single\n",
      "ranks of trees, and also with luxuriant vineyards.  Twice we entered and\n",
      "stole grapes, and the second time somebody shouted at us from some\n",
      "invisible place.  Whereupon we left again.  We speculated in grapes no\n",
      "more on that side of Athens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct, built upon arches, and\n",
      "from that time forth we had ruins all about us--we were approaching our\n",
      "journey's end.  We could not see the Acropolis now or the high hill,\n",
      "either, and I wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them, but\n",
      "the others overruled me, and we toiled laboriously up the stony hill\n",
      "immediately in our front--and from its summit saw another--climbed it and\n",
      "saw another!  It was an hour of exhausting work.  Soon we came upon a row\n",
      "of open graves, cut in the solid rock--(for a while one of them served\n",
      "Socrates for a prison)--we passed around the shoulder of the hill, and\n",
      "the citadel, in all its ruined magnificence, burst upon us!  We hurried\n",
      "across the ravine and up a winding road, and stood on the old Acropolis,\n",
      "with the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads.  We\n",
      "did not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble, or measure their\n",
      "height, or guess at their extraordinary thickness, but passed at once\n",
      "through a great arched passage like a railway tunnel, and went straight\n",
      "to the gate that leads to the ancient temples.  It was locked!  So, after\n",
      "all, it seemed that we were not to see the great Parthenon face to face.\n",
      "We sat down and held a council of war.  Result: the gate was only a\n",
      "flimsy structure of wood--we would break it down.  It seemed like\n",
      "desecration, but then we had traveled far, and our necessities were\n",
      "urgent.  We could not hunt up guides and keepers--we must be on the ship\n",
      "before daylight.  So we argued.  This was all very fine, but when we came\n",
      "to break the gate, we could not do it.  We moved around an angle of the\n",
      "wall and found a low bastion--eight feet high without--ten or twelve\n",
      "within.  Denny prepared to scale it, and we got ready to follow.  By dint\n",
      "of hard scrambling he finally straddled the top, but some loose stones\n",
      "crumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within.  There was\n",
      "instantly a banging of doors and a shout.  Denny dropped from the wall in\n",
      "a twinkling, and we retreated in disorder to the gate.  Xerxes took that\n",
      "mighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before Christ, when his five\n",
      "millions of soldiers and camp-followers followed him to Greece, and if we\n",
      "four Americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer, we\n",
      "would have taken it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garrison had turned out--four Greeks.  We clamored at the gate, and\n",
      "they admitted us.  [Bribery and corruption.]\n",
      "\n",
      "We crossed a large court, entered a great door, and stood upon a pavement\n",

      "grand Parthenon.  [We got these names from the Greek guide, who didn't\n",
      "seem to know more than seven men ought to know.] These edifices were all\n",
      "built of the whitest Pentelic marble, but have a pinkish stain upon them\n",
      "now.  Where any part is broken, however, the fracture looks like fine\n",
      "loaf sugar.  Six caryatides, or marble women, clad in flowing robes,\n",
      "support the portico of the Temple of Hercules, but the porticos and\n",

      "pillars, whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect,\n",
      "notwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the sieges\n",
      "they have suffered.  The Parthenon, originally, was two hundred and\n",
      "twenty-six feet long, one hundred wide, and seventy high, and had two\n",
      "rows of great columns, eight in each, at either end, and single rows of\n",

      "beautiful edifices ever erected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the Parthenon's imposing columns are still standing, but the roof\n",
      "is gone.  It was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago, when\n",
      "a shell dropped into the Venetian magazine stored here, and the explosion\n",
      "which followed wrecked and unroofed it.  I remember but little about the\n",

      "As we wandered thoughtfully down the marble-paved length of this stately\n",
      "temple, the scene about us was strangely impressive.  Here and there, in\n",
      "lavish profusion, were gleaming white statues of men and women, propped\n",
      "against blocks of marble, some of them armless, some without legs, others\n",
      "headless--but all looking mournful in the moonlight, and startlingly\n",
      "human!  They rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side\n",
      "--they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks and recesses;\n",
      "they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolate\n",
      "corridors; they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum, and\n",
      "solemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane; and\n",
      "through the roofless temple the moon looked down, and banded the floor\n",
      "and darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slanting\n",
      "shadows of the columns.\n",

      "workmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to the\n",
      "entablatures, covered with bas-reliefs representing battles and sieges,\n",
      "ships of war with three and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions\n",
      "--every thing one could think of.  History says that the temples of the\n",

      "vision!  Athens by moonlight!  The prophet that thought the splendors of\n",
      "the New Jerusalem were revealed to him, surely saw this instead!  It lay\n",
      "in the level plain right under our feet--all spread abroad like a\n",

      "balloon.  We saw no semblance of a street, but every house, every window,\n",
      "every clinging vine, every projection was as distinct and sharply marked\n",
      "as if the time were noon-day; and yet there was no glare, no glitter,\n",
      "nothing harsh or repulsive--the noiseless city was flooded with the\n",
      "mellowest light that ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like some\n",
      "living creature wrapped in peaceful slumber.  On its further side was a\n",
      "little temple, whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich\n",
      "lustre that chained the eye like a spell; and nearer by, the palace of\n",
      "the king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of\n",
      "shrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights\n",
      "--a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the\n",
      "moon, and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid\n",

      "reluctantly into the shadows by the wayside.  But I was not afraid.  I\n",
      "only felt that it was not right to steal grapes.  And all the more so\n",
      "when the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friends\n",
      "around also.  The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had in\n",
      "his hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but\n",
      "some holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband.  They\n",
      "evidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, and\n",
      "seemed half inclined to scalp the party.  But finally they dismissed us\n",
      "with a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and dropped\n",

      "some mysterious place, and he in turn to another!  For a mile and a half\n",

      "It was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any more\n",

      "hardly ever an isolated house.  Greece is a bleak, unsmiling desert,\n",

      "classic Illyssus has gone dry, and so have all the sources of Grecian\n",
      "wealth and greatness.  The nation numbers only eight hundred thousand\n",
      "souls, and there is poverty and misery and mendacity enough among them\n",
      "to furnish forty millions and be liberal about it.  Under King Otho the\n",

      "distance not exceeding six leagues) and from extravagant taxes on trade\n",

      "Hellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned in\n",

      "ordered to be built over the narrowest part of the Hellespont (where it\n",

      "structure, and the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors\n",
      "might have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the army\n",
      "and had them beheaded.  In the next ten minutes he let a new contract for\n",
      "the bridge.  It has been observed by ancient writers that the second\n",
      "bridge was a very good bridge.  Xerxes crossed his host of five millions\n",
      "of men on it, and if it had not been purposely destroyed, it would\n",

      "again.  The stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave and\n",

      "all the way to Yalta and escorted our procession to the Emperor's\n",
      "himself, and kept his aids scurrying about, clearing the road and\n",

      "about half-past two o'clock to breakfast.  They called it breakfast, but\n",
      "we would have called it luncheon.  It consisted of two kinds of wine;\n",
      "tea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the centre-tables\n",
      "in the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that was convenient;\n",
      "there was no ceremony.  It was a sort of picnic.  I had heard before that\n",
      "we were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he believed Baker's boy had\n",

      "does not like oakum for dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at odd\n",
      "hours, or any thing that way.  It makes him very disagreeable, because it\n",
      "makes his breath bad, and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar.  Baker's\n",
      "boy may have suggested the breakfast, but I hope he did not.  It went off\n",
      "well, anyhow.  The illustrious host moved about from place to place, and\n",
      "helped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively, and\n",
      "the Grand Duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as had\n",
      "satisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grand Duke's tea was delicious.  They give one a lemon to squeeze\n",

      "We inquired, and learned that the lions of Smyrna consisted of the ruins\n",
      "of the ancient citadel, whose broken and prodigious battlements frown\n",
      "upon the city from a lofty hill just in the edge of the town--the Mount\n",
      "Pagus of Scripture, they call it; the site of that one of the Seven\n",
      "Apocalyptic Churches of Asia which was located here in the first century\n",
      "of the Christian era; and the grave and the place of martyrdom of the\n",
      "venerable Polycarp, who suffered in Smyrna for his religion some eighteen\n",
      "hundred years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took little donkeys and started.  We saw Polycarp's tomb, and then\n",
      "hurried on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Seven Churches”--thus they abbreviate it--came next on the list.  We\n",
      "rode there--about a mile and a half in the sweltering sun--and visited a\n",
      "little Greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site; and\n",
      "we paid a small fee, and the holy attendant gave each of us a little wax\n",
      "candle as a remembrancer of the place, and I put mine in my hat and the\n",
      "sun melted it and the grease all ran down the back of my neck; and so now\n",
      "I have not any thing left but the wick, and it is a sorry and a\n",
      "wilted-looking wick at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of us argued as well as we could that the “church” mentioned in\n",
      "the Bible meant a party of Christians, and not a building; that the Bible\n",
      "spoke of them as being very poor--so poor, I thought, and so subject to\n",
      "persecution (as per Polycarp's martyrdom) that in the first place they\n",
      "probably could not have afforded a church edifice, and in the second\n",
      "would not have dared to build it in the open light of day if they could;\n",
      "and finally, that if they had had the privilege of building it, common\n",
      "judgment would have suggested that they build it somewhere near the town.\n",
      "But the elders of the ship's family ruled us down and scouted our\n",
      "evidences.  However, retribution came to them afterward.  They found that\n",
      "they had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place; they discovered\n",
      "that the accepted site is in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riding through the town, we could see marks of the six Smyrnas that have\n",
      "existed here and been burned up by fire or knocked down by earthquakes.\n",
      "The hills and the rocks are rent asunder in places, excavations expose\n",
      "great blocks of building-stone that have lain buried for ages, and all\n",
      "the mean houses and walls of modern Smyrna along the way are spotted\n",
      "white with broken pillars, capitals and fragments of sculptured marble\n",
      "that once adorned the lordly palaces that were the glory of the city in\n",
      "the olden time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ascent of the hill of the citadel is very steep, and we proceeded\n",
      "rather slowly.  But there were matters of interest about us.  In one\n",
      "place, five hundred feet above the sea, the perpendicular bank on the\n",
      "upper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high, and the cut exposed\n",
      "three veins of oyster shells, just as we have seen quartz veins exposed\n",
      "in the cutting of a road in Nevada or Montana.  The veins were about\n",
      "eighteen inches thick and two or three feet apart, and they slanted along\n",
      "downward for a distance of thirty feet or more, and then disappeared\n",
      "where the cut joined the road.  Heaven only knows how far a man might\n",
      "trace them by “stripping.”  They were clean, nice oyster shells, large,\n",
      "and just like any other oyster shells.  They were thickly massed\n",
      "together, and none were scattered above or below the veins.  Each one was\n",
      "a well-defined lead by itself, and without a spur.  My first instinct was\n",
      "to set up the usual--\n",
      "                                 NOTICE:\n",
      "\n",
      "     “We, the undersigned, claim five claims of two hundred feet each,\n",
      "     (and one for discovery,) on this ledge or lode of oyster-shells,\n",
      "     with all its dips, spurs, angles, variations and sinuosities, and\n",
      "     fifty feet on each side of the same, to work it, etc., etc.,\n",

      "They were such perfectly natural-looking leads that I could hardly keep\n",
      "from “taking them up.”  Among the oyster-shells were mixed many fragments\n",
      "of ancient, broken crockery ware.  Now how did those masses of\n",
      "oyster-shells get there?  I can not determine.  Broken crockery and\n",
      "oyster-shells are suggestive of restaurants--but then they could have\n",
      "had no such places away up there on that mountain side in our time,\n",
      "because nobody has lived up there.  A restaurant would not pay in such a\n",
      "stony, forbidding, desolate place.  And besides, there were no champagne\n",
      "corks among the shells.  If there ever was a restaurant there, it must\n",
      "have been in Smyrna's palmy days, when the hills were covered with\n",
      "palaces. I could believe in one restaurant, on those terms; but then how\n",
      "about the three?  Did they have restaurants there at three different\n",
      "periods of the world?--because there are two or three feet of solid\n",
      "earth between the oyster leads.  Evidently, the restaurant solution will\n",
      "not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hill might have been the bottom of the sea, once, and been lifted up,\n",
      "with its oyster-beds, by an earthquake--but, then, how about the\n",
      "crockery?  And moreover, how about three oyster beds, one above another,\n",
      "and thick strata of good honest earth between?\n",
      "\n",
      "That theory will not do.  It is just possible that this hill is Mount\n",
      "Ararat, and that Noah's Ark rested here, and he ate oysters and threw the\n",
      "shells overboard.  But that will not do, either.  There are the three\n",
      "layers again and the solid earth between--and, besides, there were only\n",
      "eight in Noah's family, and they could not have eaten all these oysters\n",
      "in the two or three months they staid on top of that mountain.  The\n",
      "beasts--however, it is simply absurd to suppose he did not know any more\n",
      "than to feed the beasts on oyster suppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is painful--it is even humiliating--but I am reduced at last to one\n",
      "slender theory: that the oysters climbed up there of their own accord.\n",
      "But what object could they have had in view?--what did they want up\n",
      "there?  What could any oyster want to climb a hill for?  To climb a hill\n",
      "must necessarily be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster.  The\n",
      "most natural conclusion would be that the oysters climbed up there to\n",
      "look at the scenery.  Yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of an\n",
      "oyster, it seems plain that he does not care for scenery.  An oyster has\n",
      "no taste for such things; he cares nothing for the beautiful.  An oyster\n",
      "is of a retiring disposition, and not lively--not even cheerful above the\n",
      "average, and never enterprising.  But above all, an oyster does not take\n",
      "any interest in scenery--he scorns it.  What have I arrived at now?\n",
      "Simply at the point I started from, namely, those oyster shells are\n",
      "there, in regular layers, five hundred feet above the sea, and no man\n",
      "knows how they got there.  I have hunted up the guide-books, and the gist\n",

      "In the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers.  Once\n",
      "upon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived near\n",
      "each other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of the\n",
      "Christians.  It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I am\n",
      "telling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, I\n",
      "say, that the good King Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,\n",
      "and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them.  So the seven young\n",
      "men said one to the other, let us get up and travel.  And they got up and\n",
      "traveled.  They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, or\n",
      "any friend they knew.  They only took certain moneys which their parents\n",
      "had, and garments that belonged unto their friends, whereby they might\n",
      "remember them when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, which\n",
      "was the property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run his\n",
      "head into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, and\n",
      "they had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickens\n",
      "that seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles of\n",
      "curious liquors that stood near the grocer's window; and then they\n",
      "departed from the city.  By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in the\n",
      "Hill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurried\n",
      "on again.  But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left them\n",
      "behind.  They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures.\n",
      "They were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in their\n",
      "way to make their livelihood.  Their motto was in these words, namely,\n",
      "“Procrastination is the thief of time.”  And so, whenever they did come\n",
      "upon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person hath the\n",
      "wherewithal--let us go through him.  And they went through him.  At the\n",
      "end of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure, and\n",
      "longed to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see the\n",
      "faces that were dear unto their youth.  Therefore they went through such\n",
      "parties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time, and\n",
      "journeyed back toward Ephesus again.  For the good King Maximilianus was\n",
      "become converted unto the new faith, and the Christians rejoiced because\n",
      "they were no longer persecuted.  One day as the sun went down, they came\n",
      "to the cave in the Mount of Pion, and they said, each to his fellow, Let\n",
      "us sleep here, and go and feast and make merry with our friends when the\n",
      "morning cometh.  And each of the seven lifted up his voice and said, It\n",
      "is a whiz.  So they went in, and lo, where they had put them, there lay\n",
      "the bottles of strange liquors, and they judged that age had not impaired\n",
      "their excellence.  Wherein the wanderers were right, and the heads of the\n",
      "same were level.  So each of the young men drank six bottles, and behold\n",

      "When they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed Smithianus--said, We are\n",

      "they had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as they\n",
      "approached the city, was lying upon the ground, corroded and rusted and\n",
      "defaced.  Likewise the dog Ketmehr was gone, and nothing save the brass\n",
      "that was upon his collar remained.  They wondered much at these things.\n",
      "But they took the money, and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves,\n",
      "and came up to the top of the hill.  Then were they perplexed.  The\n",
      "wonderful temple of Diana was gone; many grand edifices they had never\n",

      "the good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains\n",

      "disciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the\n",
      "holy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather the\n",
      "dust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that are\n",
      "corrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how the\n",
      "wharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are anchored\n",
      "in the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far over the\n",

      "teeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and cast\n",
      "them upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, These\n",
      "be bogus.  And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way.  When\n",
      "they were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemed\n",
      "old and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad.  They ran to the doors,\n",
      "and knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them.  And\n",
      "they said, with great excitement, while their hearts beat high, and the\n",
      "color in their faces came and went, Where is my father?  Where is my\n",
      "mother?  Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius?  And\n",
      "the strangers that opened said, We know not these.  The Seven said, How,\n",
      "you know them not?  How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they\n",
      "gone that dwelt here before ye?  And the strangers said, Ye play upon us\n",
      "with a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these\n",
      "roofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, and\n",
      "they that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung,\n",
      "have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and are\n",
      "at rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and the\n",
      "autumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks and\n",

      "strangers shut the doors upon them.  The wanderers marveled greatly, and\n",
      "looked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find one that they\n",
      "knew; but all were strange, and passed them by and spake no friendly\n",
      "word.  They were sore distressed and sad.  Presently they spake unto a\n",
      "citizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus?  And the citizen answered and\n",
      "said, Whence come ye that ye know not that great Laertius reigns in\n",
      "Ephesus?  They looked one at the other, greatly perplexed, and presently\n",
      "asked again, Where, then, is the good King Maximilianus?  The citizen\n",

      "When I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus.  We are in Syria, now,\n",
      "encamped in the mountains of Lebanon.  The interregnum has been long,\n",
      "both as to time and distance.  We brought not a relic from Ephesus!\n",
      "After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments\n",
      "from the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost\n",
      "of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway\n",
      "depot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to\n",
      "disgorge!  He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party,\n",
      "and see that we carried nothing off.  It was a wise, a just, and a\n",
      "well-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation.  I never resist a\n",
      "temptation to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably\n",
      "vain about it.  This time I felt proud beyond expression.  I was serene\n",
      "in the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman\n",
      "government for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely\n",
      "respectable gentlemen and ladies I said, “We that have free souls, it\n",
      "touches us not.”  The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched\n",
      "hard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was\n",
      "inclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy at\n",
      "Constantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by the\n",
      "representative of the Queen.  This was bad--very bad.  Coming solely\n",
      "from the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred of\n",
      "Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing\n",
      "it; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic British\n",
      "legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and\n",
      "ladies who would bear watching!  So the party regarded it, and were\n",
      "incensed accordingly.  The truth doubtless was, that the same\n",
      "precautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the\n",
      "English Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and\n",
      "have paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve\n",
      "to be. They can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitality\n",
      "abused by travelers, especially since travelers are such notorious\n",
      "scorners of honest behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy, for the chief\n",
      "feature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near at hand--we were\n",
      "approaching the Holy Land!  Such a burrowing into the hold for trunks\n",
      "that had lain buried for weeks, yes for months; such a hurrying to and\n",
      "fro above decks and below; such a riotous system of packing and\n",
      "unpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts, and\n",
      "indescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such a making up of bundles,\n",
      "and setting apart of umbrellas, green spectacles and thick veils; such a\n",
      "critical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touched\n",
      "horses; such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining of\n",
      "bowie-knives; such a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons with\n",
      "serviceable buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such a\n",
      "reading up of Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out of\n",
      "routes; such exasperating efforts to divide up the company into little\n",
      "bands of congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous Journey\n",
      "without quarreling; and morning, noon and night, such mass-meetings in\n",
      "the cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such worrying and\n",
      "quarreling, and such a general raising of the very mischief, was never\n",
      "seen in the ship before!\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is all over now.  We are cut up into parties of six or eight, and\n",
      "by this time are scattered far and wide.  Ours is the only one, however,\n",
      "that is venturing on what is called “the long trip”--that is, out into\n",
      "Syria, by Baalbec to Damascus, and thence down through the full length of\n",
      "Palestine.  It would be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at this\n",
      "hot season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomed\n",
      "somewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air.  The other parties\n",
      "will take shorter journeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of this\n",
      "Holy Land pilgrimage.  I refer to transportation service.  We knew very\n",
      "well that Palestine was a country which did not do a large passenger\n",
      "business, and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave\n",
      "us to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomen\n",
      "and animals.  At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the\n",
      "American Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanted\n",
      "dragomen and transportation.  We were desperate--would take horses,\n",
      "jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing.  At Smyrna, more\n",
      "telegraphing was done, to the same end.  Also fearing for the worst, we\n",
      "telegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus,\n",
      "and horses for the ruins of Baalbec.\n",
      "\n",
      "As might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria and Egypt that\n",
      "the whole population of the Province of America (the Turks consider us a\n",
      "trifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world,) were\n",
      "coming to the Holy Land--and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, we\n",
      "found the place full of dragomen and their outfits.  We had all intended\n",
      "to go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off to Baalbec as we went\n",
      "along--because we expected to rejoin the ship, go to Mount Carmel, and\n",
      "take to the woods from there.  However, when our own private party of\n",
      "eight found that it was possible, and proper enough, to make the “long\n",
      "trip,” we adopted that programme.  We have never been much trouble to a\n",
      "Consul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our Consul at\n",
      "Beirout.  I mention this because I can not help admiring his patience,\n",
      "his industry, and his accommodating spirit.  I mention it also, because I\n",
      "think some of our ship's company did not give him as full credit for his\n",
      "excellent services as he deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all business\n",
      "connected with the expedition.  The rest of us had nothing to do but look\n",
      "at the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright, new houses nestled\n",
      "among a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland that\n",
      "sloped gently down to the sea; and also at the mountains of Lebanon that\n",
      "environ it; and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water that\n",
      "rolled its billows about the ship (we did not know there were sharks\n",
      "there.) We had also to range up and down through the town and look at the\n",
      "costumes.  These are picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as at\n",
      "Constantinople and Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony--in the two\n",
      "former cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (and\n",
      "they often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entire\n",
      "faces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like mummies,\n",
      "and then expose their breasts to the public.  A young gentleman (I\n",
      "believe he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us around the city, and said\n",
      "it would afford him great pleasure, because he was studying English and\n",
      "wanted practice in that language.  When we had finished the rounds,\n",
      "however, he called for remuneration--said he hoped the gentlemen would\n",
      "give him a trifle in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few five\n",
      "cent pieces.)  We did so.  The Consul was surprised when he heard it, and\n",
      "said he knew the young fellow's family very well, and that they were an\n",
      "old and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousand\n",
      "dollars!  Some people, so situated, would have been ashamed of the berth\n",
      "he had with us and his manner of crawling into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the appointed time our business committee reported, and said all\n",
      "things were in readdress--that we were to start to-day, with horses, pack\n",
      "animals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the Sea of Tiberias, and\n",
      "thence southward by the way of the scene of Jacob's Dream and other\n",
      "notable Bible localities to Jerusalem--from thence probably to the Dead\n",
      "Sea, but possibly not--and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship\n",
      "three or four weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, in\n",
      "gold, and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman.  They said we\n",
      "would lie as well as at a hotel.  I had read something like that before,\n",
      "and did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it.  I said nothing,\n",
      "however, but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes and\n",
      "tobacco, two or three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and a\n",
      "Bible.  I also took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respect\n",
      "in the Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were to select our horses at 3 P.M.  At that hour Abraham, the\n",
      "dragoman, marshaled them before us.  With all solemnity I set it down\n",
      "here, that those horses were the hardest lot I ever did come across, and\n",
      "their accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style.  One\n",
      "brute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close, like a\n",
      "rabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge running from his\n",
      "neck to his tail, like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about Rome,\n",
      "and had a neck on him like a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sore\n",
      "backs, and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about their\n",
      "persons like brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous to\n",
      "contemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession looked\n",
      "like a fleet in a storm.  It was fearful.  Blucher shook his head and\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“That dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these old\n",
      "crates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he has got a permit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said nothing.  The display was exactly according to the guide-book, and\n",
      "were we not traveling by the guide-book?  I selected a certain horse\n",
      "because I thought I saw him shy, and I thought that a horse that had\n",
      "spirit enough to shy was not to be despised.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 6 o'clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a\n",
      "shapely mountain overlooking the sea, and the handsome valley where dwelt\n",
      "some of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much\n",
      "about; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram, King of\n",
      "Tyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills to\n",
      "build portions of King Solomon's Temple with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after six, our pack train arrived.  I had not seen it before, and\n",
      "a good right I had to be astonished.  We had nineteen serving men and\n",
      "twenty-six pack mules!  It was a perfect caravan.  It looked like one,\n",
      "too, as it wound among the rocks.  I wondered what in the very mischief\n",
      "we wanted with such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men.  I wondered\n",
      "awhile, but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon and\n",
      "beans.  I had camped out many and many a time before, and knew just what\n",
      "was coming.  I went off, without waiting for serving men, and unsaddled\n",
      "my horse, and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projected\n",
      "through his hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tents\n",
      "were up--tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and gold, and\n",
      "crimson, and all manner of splendid adornment!  I was speechless.  Then\n",
      "they brought eight little iron bedsteads, and set them up in the tents;\n",
      "they put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snow-white\n",
      "sheets on each bed.  Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, and\n",
      "on it placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of towels\n",
      "--one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the tent, and said we\n",
      "could put our small trifles in them for convenience, and if we needed\n",
      "pins or such things, they were sticking every where.  Then came the\n",
      "finishing touch--they spread carpets on the floor!  I simply said, “If\n",
      "you call this camping out, all right--but it isn't the style I am used\n",
      "to; my little baggage that I brought along is at a discount.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It grew dark, and they put candles on the tables--candles set in bright,\n",
      "new, brazen candlesticks.  And soon the bell--a genuine, simon-pure bell\n",
      "--rang, and we were invited to “the saloon.”  I had thought before that\n",
      "we had a tent or so too many, but now here was one, at least, provided\n",
      "for; it was to be used for nothing but an eating-saloon.  Like the\n",
      "others, it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in, and was\n",
      "very handsome and clean and bright-colored within.  It was a gem of a\n",
      "place.  A table for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth and\n",
      "napkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we\n",
      "were used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks,\n",
      "soup-plates, dinner-plates--every thing, in the handsomest kind of\n",
      "style.  It was wonderful!  And they call this camping out.  Those\n",
      "stately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in a\n",
      "dinner which consisted of roast mutton, roast chicken, roast goose,\n",
      "potatoes, bread, tea, pudding, apples, and delicious grapes; the viands\n",
      "were better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks, and the table made a\n",
      "finer appearance, with its large German silver candlesticks and other\n",
      "finery, than any table we had sat down to for a good while, and yet that\n",
      "polite dragoman, Abraham, came bowing in and apologizing for the whole\n",
      "affair, on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting under way for\n",
      "a very long trip, and promising to do a great deal better in future!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "They call this camping out.  At this rate it is a glorious privilege to\n",
      "be a pilgrim to the Holy Land.\n",

      "We are camped near Temnin-el-Foka--a name which the boys have simplified\n",
      "a good deal, for the sake of convenience in spelling.  They call it\n",
      "Jacksonville.  It sounds a little strangely, here in the Valley of\n",

      "half-past five this morning and the cry went abroad of “Ten minutes to\n",
      "dress for breakfast!”  I heard both.  It surprised me, because I have not\n",
      "heard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month, and whenever we have\n",
      "had occasion to fire a salute at daylight, I have only found it out in\n",
      "the course of conversation afterward.  However, camping out, even though\n",
      "it be in a gorgeous tent, makes one fresh and lively in the morning\n",
      "--especially if the air you are breathing is the cool, fresh air of the\n",
      "mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was dressed within the ten minutes, and came out.  The saloon tent had\n",
      "been stripped of its sides, and had nothing left but its roof; so when we\n",
      "sat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain,\n",
      "sea and hazy valley.  And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up and\n",
      "suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot mutton chops, fried chicken, omelettes, fried potatoes and coffee\n",
      "--all excellent.  This was the bill of fare.  It was sauced with a savage\n",
      "appetite purchased by hard riding the day before, and refreshing sleep in\n",

      "over my shoulder, and behold our white village was gone--the splendid\n",

      "By half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to be\n",
      "under way also.  The road was filled with mule trains and long\n",
      "processions of camels.  This reminds me that we have been trying for some\n",
      "time to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out.  When\n",
      "he is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, he\n",
      "looks something like a goose swimming; and when he is upright he looks\n",
      "like an ostrich with an extra set of legs.  Camels are not beautiful, and\n",
      "their long under lip gives them an exceedingly “gallus”--[Excuse the\n",
      "slang, no other word will describe it]--expression.  They have immense,\n",
      "flat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the dust like a pie\n",
      "with a slice cut out of it.  They are not particular about their diet.\n",
      "They would eat a tombstone if they could bite it.  A thistle grows about\n",
      "here which has needles on it that would pierce through leather, I think;\n",
      "if one touches you, you can find relief in nothing but profanity.  The\n",

      "While I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now by\n",
      "the name of “Jericho.”  He is a mare.  I have seen remarkable horses\n",
      "before, but none so remarkable as this.  I wanted a horse that could shy,\n",
      "and this one fills the bill.  I had an idea that shying indicated spirit.\n",
      "If I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth.  He shies\n",
      "at every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality.  He appears\n",
      "to have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it is\n",
      "fortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now,\n",
      "I never fall off twice in succession on the same side.  If I fell on the\n",
      "same side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while.  This\n",
      "creature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack.\n",
      "He walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were\n",
      "astonishing.  And it would fill any one with admiration to see how he\n",
      "preserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack.  This\n",
      "dare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the Holy\n",
      "Land.  He has only one fault.  His tail has been chopped off or else he\n",
      "has sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight the\n",
      "flies with his heels.  This is all very well, but when he tries to kick a\n",
      "fly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety.\n",
      "He is going to get himself into trouble that way some day.  He reaches\n",
      "around and bites my legs too.  I do not care particularly about that,\n",
      "only I do not like to see a horse too sociable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him.  He had an\n",
      "idea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of\n",
      "that character.  I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought\n",
      "the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle\n",
      "and shouting in Arabic, “Ho! will you?  Do you want to run away, you\n",
      "ferocious beast, and break your neck?” when all the time the horse was\n",
      "not doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean\n",
      "up against something and think.  Whenever he is not shying at things, or\n",
      "reaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet.  How it would surprise his\n",
      "owner to know this.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been in a historical section of country all day.  At noon we\n",
      "camped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of the\n",
      "Lebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into the\n",
      "immense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon.  To-night we are camping\n",
      "near the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view.  We can\n",
      "see the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the\n",
      "eastern hills.  The “dews of Hermon” are falling upon us now, and the\n",

      "It is utterly inaccessible, except in one place, where a bridle-path\n",

      "of Jacob had been pasturing their flocks near there.  Their father grew\n",
      "uneasy at their long absence, and sent Joseph, his favorite, to see if\n",
      "any thing had gone wrong with them.  He traveled six or seven days'\n",
      "journey; he was only seventeen years old, and, boy like, he toiled\n",
      "through that long stretch of the vilest, rockiest, dustiest country in\n",
      "Asia, arrayed in the pride of his heart, his beautiful claw-hammer coat\n",
      "of many colors.  Joseph was the favorite, and that was one crime in the\n",
      "eyes of his brethren; he had dreamed dreams, and interpreted them to\n",
      "foreshadow his elevation far above all his family in the far future, and\n",
      "that was another; he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed the\n",
      "harmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before his\n",
      "brothers.  These were crimes his elders fretted over among themselves and\n",
      "proposed to punish when the opportunity should offer.  When they saw him\n",
      "coming up from the Sea of Galilee, they recognized him and were glad.\n",
      "They said, “Lo, here is this dreamer--let us kill him.”  But Reuben\n",
      "pleaded for his life, and they spared it.  But they seized the boy, and\n",
      "stripped the hated coat from his back and pushed him into the pit.  They\n",
      "intended to let him die there, but Reuben intended to liberate him\n",
      "secretly.  However, while Reuben was away for a little while, the\n",
      "brethren sold Joseph to some Ishmaelitish merchants who were journeying\n",
      "towards Egypt.  Such is the history of the pit.  And the self-same pit is\n",
      "there in that place, even to this day; and there it will remain until the\n",
      "next detachment of image-breakers and tomb desecraters arrives from the\n",
      "Quaker City excursion, and they will infallibly dig it up and carry it\n",
      "away with them.  For behold in them is no reverence for the solemn\n",

      "thirteen years of romantic mystery, the brethren who had wronged Joseph,\n",
      "came, strangers in a strange land, hungry and humble, to buy “a little\n",
      "food”; and being summoned to a palace, charged with crime, they beheld in\n",
      "its owner their wronged brother; they were trembling beggars--he, the\n",
      "lord of a mighty empire!  What Joseph that ever lived would have thrown\n",

      "aspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its lagging\n",
      "seasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts upon their\n",

      "miraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported\n",

      "their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at the\n",
      "peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of.  When the Virgin\n",
      "fled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the same\n",

      "happened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because the\n",
      "strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the living\n",
      "rock will last forever.  It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it is\n",
      "one that all men ought to thank the Catholics for.  Wherever they ferret\n",
      "out a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightway\n",
      "build a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve the\n",
      "memory of that locality for the gratification of future generations.  If\n",
      "it had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would not\n",
      "even know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put his\n",
      "finger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world.  The world owes the\n",
      "Catholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these\n",
      "bogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory to\n",
      "look at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuries\n",
      "that the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place for\n",
      "her somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this town\n",
      "of Nazareth.  There is too large a scope of country.  The imagination can\n",
      "not work.  There is no one particular spot to chain your eye, rivet your\n",
      "interest, and make you think.  The memory of the Pilgrims can not perish\n",
      "while Plymouth Rock remains to us.  The old monks are wise.  They know\n",

      "the little fragments of the ancient walls which remain.  Our pilgrims\n",
      "broke off specimens.  We visited, also, a new chapel, in the midst of the\n",
      "town, which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet\n",
      "thick; the priests discovered, a few years ago, that the disciples had\n",

      "populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly,\n",
      "and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in\n",
      "the parlor.  Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky,\n",

      "themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and\n",

      "noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost\n",
      "an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking\n",
      "at you.  We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once\n",
      "more.  Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in\n",
      "life is to get ahead of each other.\n",

      "A fast walker could go outside the walls of Jerusalem and walk entirely\n",
      "around the city in an hour.  I do not know how else to make one\n",
      "understand how small it is.  The appearance of the city is peculiar.  It\n",
      "is as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is with\n",
      "bolt-heads.  Every house has from one to half a dozen of these white\n",
      "plastered domes of stone, broad and low, sitting in the centre of, or in\n",
      "a cluster upon, the flat roof.  Wherefore, when one looks down from an\n",
      "eminence, upon the compact mass of houses (so closely crowded together,\n",
      "in fact, that there is no appearance of streets at all, and so the city\n",
      "looks solid,) he sees the knobbiest town in the world, except\n",
      "Constantinople. It looks as if it might be roofed, from centre to\n",
      "circumference, with inverted saucers.  The monotony of the view is\n",
      "interrupted only by the great Mosque of Omar, the Tower of Hippicus, and\n",
      "one or two other buildings that rise into commanding prominence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The houses are generally two stories high, built strongly of masonry,\n",
      "whitewashed or plastered outside, and have a cage of wooden lattice-work\n",
      "projecting in front of every window.  To reproduce a Jerusalem street, it\n",
      "would only be necessary to up-end a chicken-coop and hang it before each\n",
      "window in an alley of American houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets are roughly and badly paved with stone, and are tolerably\n",
      "crooked--enough so to make each street appear to close together\n",
      "constantly and come to an end about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim as\n",
      "long as he chooses to walk in it.  Projecting from the top of the lower\n",
      "story of many of the houses is a very narrow porch-roof or shed, without\n",
      "supports from below; and I have several times seen cats jump across the\n",
      "street from one shed to the other when they were out calling.  The cats\n",
      "could have jumped double the distance without extraordinary exertion.  I\n",
      "mention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are.\n",
      "Since a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience, it is\n",
      "hardly necessary to state that such streets are too narrow for carriages.\n",
      "These vehicles cannot navigate the Holy City.\n",
      "\n",
      "The population of Jerusalem is composed of Moslems, Jews, Greeks, Latins,\n",
      "Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics, and a handful of\n",
      "Protestants.  One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in\n",
      "this birthplace of Christianity.  The nice shades of nationality\n",
      "comprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are\n",
      "altogether too numerous to mention.  It seems to me that all the races\n",
      "and colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the\n",
      "fourteen thousand souls that dwell in Jerusalem.  Rags, wretchedness,\n",
      "poverty and dirt, those signs and symbols that indicate the presence of\n",
      "Moslem rule more surely than the crescent-flag itself, abound.  Lepers,\n",
      "cripples, the blind, and the idiotic, assail you on every hand, and they\n",

      "“bucksheesh.”  To see the numbers of maimed, malformed and diseased\n",
      "humanity that throng the holy places and obstruct the gates, one might\n",
      "suppose that the ancient days had come again, and that the angel of the\n",
      "Lord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters of\n",
      "Bethesda.  Jerusalem is mournful, and dreary, and lifeless.  I would not\n",

      "\n",
      "One naturally goes first to the Holy Sepulchre.  It is right in the city,\n",
      "near the western gate; it and the place of the Crucifixion, and, in fact,\n",
      "every other place intimately connected with that tremendous event, are\n",
      "ingeniously massed together and covered by one roof--the dome of the\n",

      "Entering the building, through the midst of the usual assemblage of\n",

      "different sects will not only quarrel, but fight, also, in this sacred\n",
      "place, if allowed to do it.  Before you is a marble slab, which covers\n",
      "the Stone of Unction, whereon the Saviour's body was laid to prepare it\n",
      "for burial.  It was found necessary to conceal the real stone in this way\n",
      "in order to save it from destruction.  Pilgrims were too much given to\n",
      "chipping off pieces of it to carry home.  Near by is a circular railing\n",

      "Entering the great Rotunda, we stand before the most sacred locality in\n",
      "Christendom--the grave of Jesus.  It is in the centre of the church, and\n",
      "immediately under the great dome.  It is inclosed in a sort of little\n",
      "temple of yellow and white stone, of fanciful design.  Within the little\n",
      "temple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the door\n",
      "of the Sepulchre, and on which the angel was sitting when Mary came\n",
      "thither “at early dawn.”  Stooping low, we enter the vault--the Sepulchre\n",
      "itself.  It is only about six feet by seven, and the stone couch on which\n",
      "the dead Saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment and\n",
      "occupies half its width.  It is covered with a marble slab which has been\n",
      "much worn by the lips of pilgrims.  This slab serves as an altar, now.\n",
      "Over it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps, which are kept always\n",
      "burning, and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery, gewgaws, and\n",
      "tawdry ornamentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sects of Christians (except Protestants,) have chapels under the roof\n",
      "of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and each must keep to itself and not\n",
      "venture upon another's ground.  It has been proven conclusively that they\n",
      "can not worship together around the grave of the Saviour of the World in\n",
      "peace.  The chapel of the Syrians is not handsome; that of the Copts is\n",
      "the humblest of them all.  It is nothing but a dismal cavern, roughly\n",
      "hewn in the living rock of the Hill of Calvary.  In one side of it two\n",

      "monks, with candles in their hands, who were chanting something in Latin,\n",
      "and going through some kind of religious performance around a disk of\n",
      "white marble let into the floor.  It was there that the risen Saviour\n",
      "appeared to Mary Magdalen in the likeness of a gardener.  Near by was a\n",
      "similar stone, shaped like a star--here the Magdalen herself stood, at\n",
      "the same time.  Monks were performing in this place also.  They perform\n",
      "everywhere--all over the vast building, and at all hours.  Their candles\n",
      "are always flitting about in the gloom, and making the dim old church\n",
      "more dismal than there is any necessity that it should be, even though it\n",
      "is a tomb.\n",

      "We were shown the place where our Lord appeared to His mother after the\n",
      "Resurrection.  Here, also, a marble slab marks the place where St.\n",
      "Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, found the crosses about\n",
      "three hundred years after the Crucifixion.  According to the legend, this\n",
      "great discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy.  But they\n",
      "were of short duration.  The question intruded itself: “Which bore the\n",
      "blessed Saviour, and which the thieves?”  To be in doubt, in so mighty a\n",
      "matter as this--to be uncertain which one to adore--was a grievous\n",
      "misfortune.  It turned the public joy to sorrow.  But when lived there a\n",
      "holy priest who could not set so simple a trouble as this at rest?  One\n",
      "of these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test.  A noble lady\n",
      "lay very ill in Jerusalem.  The wise priests ordered that the three\n",
      "crosses be taken to her bedside one at a time.  It was done.  When her\n",
      "eyes fell upon the first one, she uttered a scream that was heard beyond\n",
      "the Damascus Gate, and even upon the Mount of Olives, it was said, and\n",
      "then fell back in a deadly swoon.  They recovered her and brought the\n",
      "second cross.  Instantly she went into fearful convulsions, and it was\n",
      "with the greatest difficulty that six strong men could hold her.  They\n",
      "were afraid, now, to bring in the third cross.  They began to fear that\n",
      "possibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses, and that the true cross\n",
      "was not with this number at all.  However, as the woman seemed likely to\n",
      "die with the convulsions that were tearing her, they concluded that the\n",
      "third could do no more than put her out of her misery with a happy\n",
      "dispatch.  So they brought it, and behold, a miracle!  The woman sprang\n",
      "from her bed, smiling and joyful, and perfectly restored to health.  When\n",
      "we listen to evidence like this, we cannot but believe.  We would be\n",
      "ashamed to doubt, and properly, too.  Even the very part of Jerusalem\n",
      "where this all occurred is there yet.  So there is really no room for\n",
      "doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The priests tried to show us, through a small screen, a fragment of the\n",
      "genuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they\n",
      "scourged him.  But we could not see it, because it was dark inside the\n",
      "screen.  However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim thrusts through\n",
      "a hole in the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillar\n",
      "of Flagellation is in there.  He can not have any excuse to doubt it, for\n",
      "he can feel it with the stick.  He can feel it as distinctly as he could\n",
      "feel any thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of the\n",
      "True Cross, but it is gone, now.  This piece of the cross was discovered\n",
      "in the sixteenth century.  The Latin priests say it was stolen away, long\n",
      "ago, by priests of another sect.  That seems like a hard statement to\n",
      "make, but we know very well that it was stolen, because we have seen it\n",
      "ourselves in several of the cathedrals of Italy and France.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stout\n",
      "Crusader, Godfrey of Bulloigne--King Godfrey of Jerusalem.  No blade in\n",
      "Christendom wields such enchantment as this--no blade of all that rust in\n",
      "the ancestral halls of Europe is able to invoke such visions of romance\n",
      "in the brain of him who looks upon it--none that can prate of such\n",
      "chivalric deeds or tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old.  It\n",
      "stirs within a man every memory of the Holy Wars that has been sleeping\n",
      "in his brain for years, and peoples his thoughts with mail-clad images,\n",
      "with marching armies, with battles and with sieges.  It speaks to him of\n",
      "Baldwin, and Tancred, the princely Saladin, and great Richard of the Lion\n",
      "Heart.  It was with just such blades as these that these splendid heroes\n",
      "of romance used to segregate a man, so to speak, and leave the half of\n",
      "him to fall one way and the other half the other.  This very sword has\n",
      "cloven hundreds of Saracen Knights from crown to chin in those old times\n",
      "when Godfrey wielded it.  It was enchanted, then, by a genius that was\n",
      "under the command of King Solomon.  When danger approached its master's\n",
      "tent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon the\n",
      "startled ear of night.  In times of doubt, or in fog or darkness, if it\n",
      "were drawn from its sheath it would point instantly toward the foe, and\n",
      "thus reveal the way--and it would also attempt to start after them of its\n",
      "own accord.  A Christian could not be so disguised that it would not know\n",
      "him and refuse to hurt him--nor a Moslem so disguised that it would not\n",
      "leap from its scabbard and take his life.  These statements are all well\n",
      "authenticated in many legends that are among the most trustworthy legends\n",
      "the good old Catholic monks preserve.  I can never forget old Godfrey's\n",
      "sword, now.  I tried it on a Moslem, and clove him in twain like a\n",
      "doughnut.  The spirit of Grimes was upon me, and if I had had a graveyard\n",
      "I would have destroyed all the infidels in Jerusalem.  I wiped the blood\n",
      "off the old sword and handed it back to the priest--I did not want the\n",
      "fresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightness\n",
      "one day six hundred years ago and thus gave Godfrey warning that before\n",
      "the sun went down his journey of life would end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still moving through the gloom of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre we\n",
      "came to a small chapel, hewn out of the rock--a place which has been\n",
      "known as “The Prison of Our Lord” for many centuries.  Tradition says\n",
      "that here the Saviour was confined just previously to the crucifixion.\n",
      "Under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs.\n",
      "These things are called the “Bonds of Christ,” and the use they were once\n",
      "put to has given them the name they now bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greek Chapel is the most roomy, the richest and the showiest chapel\n",
      "in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Its altar, like that of all the\n",
      "Greek churches, is a lofty screen that extends clear across the chapel,\n",
      "and is gorgeous with gilding and pictures.  The numerous lamps that hang\n",
      "before it are of gold and silver, and cost great sums.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middle\n",
      "of the marble pavement of the chapel, and marks the exact centre of the\n",
      "earth.  The most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be\n",
      "the earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon earth he set\n",
      "all doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lips\n",
      "that the tradition was correct.  Remember, He said that that particular\n",
      "column stood upon the centre of the world.  If the centre of the world\n",
      "changes, the column changes its position accordingly.  This column has\n",
      "moved three different times of its own accord.  This is because, in great\n",
      "convulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth\n",
      "--whole ranges of mountains, probably--have flown off into space, thus\n",
      "lessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the exact locality of\n",
      "its centre by a point or two.  This is a very curious and interesting\n",
      "circumstance, and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would\n",
      "make us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth to\n",
      "fly off into space.\n",
      "\n",
      "To satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth, a\n",
      "sceptic once paid well for the privilege of ascending to the dome of the\n",
      "church to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon.  He came down\n",
      "perfectly convinced.  The day was very cloudy and the sun threw no\n",
      "shadows at all; but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out\n",
      "and made shadows it could not have made any for him.  Proofs like these\n",
      "are not to be set aside by the idle tongues of cavilers.  To such as are\n",
      "not bigoted, and are willing to be convinced, they carry a conviction\n",
      "that nothing can ever shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "If even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are wanted, to satisfy\n",
      "the headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of the\n",
      "earth, they are here.  The greatest of them lies in the fact that from\n",
      "under this very column was taken the dust from which Adam was made.  This\n",
      "can surely be regarded in the light of a settler.  It is not likely that\n",
      "the original first man would have been made from an inferior quality of\n",
      "earth when it was entirely convenient to get first quality from the\n",
      "world's centre.  This will strike any reflecting mind forcibly.  That\n",
      "Adam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by the\n",
      "fact that in six thousand years no man has ever been able to prove that\n",

      "the circumference of the Hill of Calvary.  And in this self-same spot the\n",

      "nothing less than the copper plate Pilate put upon the Saviour's cross,\n",
      "and upon which he wrote, “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”  I think St.\n",
      "Helena, the mother of Constantine, found this wonderful memento when she\n",
      "was here in the third century.  She traveled all over Palestine, and was\n",
      "always fortunate.  Whenever the good old enthusiast found a thing\n",
      "mentioned in her Bible, Old or New, she would go and search for that\n",
      "thing, and never stop until she found it.  If it was Adam, she would find\n",
      "Adam; if it was the Ark, she would find the Ark; if it was Goliath, or\n",
      "Joshua, she would find them.  She found the inscription here that I was\n",
      "speaking of, I think.  She found it in this very spot, close to where the\n",
      "martyred Roman soldier stood.  That copper plate is in one of the\n",
      "churches in Rome, now.  Any one can see it there.  The inscription is\n",
      "very distinct.\n",

      "We passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spot\n",

      "Then we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern.\n",
      "It is a chapel, now, however--the Chapel of St. Helena.  It is fifty-one\n",

      "she was searching for the true Cross.  She had a laborious piece of work,\n",
      "here, but it was richly rewarded.  Out of this place she got the crown of\n",
      "thorns, the nails of the cross, the true Cross itself, and the cross of\n",
      "the penitent thief.  When she thought she had found every thing and was\n",
      "about to stop, she was told in a dream to continue a day longer.  It was\n",

      "arches and by dingy piers and columns; through a sombre cathedral gloom\n",
      "freighted with smoke and incense, and faintly starred with scores of\n",
      "candles that appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared, or drifted\n",
      "mysteriously hither and thither about the distant aisles like ghostly\n",
      "jack-o'-lanterns--we came at last to a small chapel which is called the\n",
      "“Chapel of the Mocking.”  Under the altar was a fragment of a marble\n",
      "column; this was the seat Christ sat on when he was reviled, and\n",
      "mockingly made King, crowned with a crown of thorns and sceptred with a\n",
      "reed.  It was here that they blindfolded him and struck him, and said in\n",
      "derision, “Prophesy who it is that smote thee.”  The tradition that this\n",
      "is the identical spot of the mocking is a very ancient one.  The guide\n",
      "said that Saewulf was the first to mention it.  I do not know Saewulf,\n",

      "They showed us where the great Godfrey and his brother Baldwin, the first\n",
      "Christian Kings of Jerusalem, once lay buried by that sacred sepulchre\n",
      "they had fought so long and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of the\n",
      "infidel.  But the niches that had contained the ashes of these renowned\n",
      "crusaders were empty.  Even the coverings of their tombs were gone\n",
      "--destroyed by devout members of the Greek Church, because Godfrey and\n",
      "Baldwin were Latin princes, and had been reared in a Christian faith\n",
      "whose creed differed in some unimportant respects from theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed on, and halted before the tomb of Melchisedek!  You will\n",
      "remember Melchisedek, no doubt; he was the King who came out and levied a\n",
      "tribute on Abraham the time that he pursued Lot's captors to Dan, and\n",
      "took all their property from them.  That was about four thousand years\n",
      "ago, and Melchisedek died shortly afterward.  However, his tomb is in a\n",
      "good state of preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sepulchre itself is\n",
      "the first thing he desires to see, and really is almost the first thing\n",
      "he does see.  The next thing he has a strong yearning to see is the spot\n",
      "where the Saviour was crucified.  But this they exhibit last.  It is the\n",
      "crowning glory of the place.  One is grave and thoughtful when he stands\n",
      "in the little Tomb of the Saviour--he could not well be otherwise in such\n",
      "a place--but he has not the slightest possible belief that ever the Lord\n",
      "lay there, and so the interest he feels in the spot is very, very greatly\n",
      "marred by that reflection.  He looks at the place where Mary stood, in\n",
      "another part of the church, and where John stood, and Mary Magdalen;\n",
      "where the mob derided the Lord; where the angel sat; where the crown of\n",
      "thorns was found, and the true Cross; where the risen Saviour appeared\n",
      "--he looks at all these places with interest, but with the same conviction\n",
      "he felt in the case of the Sepulchre, that there is nothing genuine about\n",
      "them, and that they are imaginary holy places created by the monks.  But\n",
      "the place of the Crucifixion affects him differently.  He fully believes\n",
      "that he is looking upon the very spot where the Savior gave up his\n",
      "life.  He remembers that Christ was very celebrated, long before he came\n",
      "to Jerusalem; he knows that his fame was so great that crowds followed\n",
      "him all the time; he is aware that his entry into the city produced a\n",
      "stirring sensation, and that his reception was a kind of ovation; he can\n",
      "not overlook the fact that when he was crucified there were very many in\n",
      "Jerusalem who believed that he was the true Son of God.  To publicly\n",
      "execute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality of\n",
      "the execution a memorable place for ages; added to this, the storm, the\n",
      "darkness, the earthquake, the rending of the vail of the Temple, and the\n",
      "untimely waking of the dead, were events calculated to fix the execution\n",
      "and the scene of it in the memory of even the most thoughtless witness.\n",
      "Fathers would tell their sons about the strange affair, and point out the\n",
      "spot; the sons would transmit the story to their children, and thus a\n",
      "period of three hundred years would easily be spanned--[The thought is\n",
      "Mr. Prime's, not mine, and is full of good sense.  I borrowed it from his\n",
      "“Tent Life.”--M.  T.]--at which time Helena came and built a church upon\n",
      "Calvary to commemorate the death and burial of the Lord and preserve the\n",
      "sacred place in the memories of men; since that time there has always\n",
      "been a church there.  It is not possible that there can be any mistake\n",
      "about the locality of the Crucifixion.  Not half a dozen persons knew\n",
      "where they buried the Saviour, perhaps, and a burial is not a startling\n",
      "event, any how; therefore, we can be pardoned for unbelief in the\n",
      "Sepulchre, but not in the place of the Crucifixion.  Five hundred years\n",
      "hence there will be no vestige of Bunker Hill Monument left, but America\n",
      "will still know where the battle was fought and where Warren fell.  The\n",
      "crucifixion of Christ was too notable an event in Jerusalem, and the Hill\n",
      "of Calvary made too celebrated by it, to be forgotten in the short space\n",
      "of three hundred years.  I climbed the stairway in the church which\n",
      "brings one to the top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock, and looked\n",
      "upon the place where the true cross once stood, with a far more absorbing\n",
      "interest than I had ever felt in any thing earthly before.  I could not\n",
      "believe that the three holes in the top of the rock were the actual ones\n",
      "the crosses stood in, but I felt satisfied that those crosses had stood\n",
      "so near the place now occupied by them, that the few feet of possible\n",
      "difference were a matter of no consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one stands where the Saviour was crucified, he finds it all he can\n",
      "do to keep it strictly before his mind that Christ was not crucified in a\n",
      "Catholic Church.  He must remind himself every now and then that the\n",
      "great event transpired in the open air, and not in a gloomy,\n",
      "candle-lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs\n",
      "--a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation,\n",
      "in execrable taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under a marble altar like a table, is a circular hole in the marble\n",
      "floor, corresponding with the one just under it in which the true Cross\n",
      "stood.  The first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candle\n",
      "and examine this hole.  He does this strange prospecting with an amount\n",
      "of gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who has\n",
      "not seen the operation.  Then he holds his candle before a richly\n",
      "engraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab of gold, and\n",
      "wonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the hole\n",
      "within the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration.  He\n",
      "rises and faces the finely wrought figures of the Saviour and the\n",
      "malefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright with\n",
      "a metallic lustre of many colors.  He turns next to the figures close to\n",
      "them of the Virgin and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rock\n",
      "made by the earthquake at the time of the Crucifixion, and an extension\n",
      "of which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below; he\n",
      "looks next at the show-case with a figure of the Virgin in it, and is\n",
      "amazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so\n",
      "thickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost.  All about\n",
      "the apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church offend the eye and\n",
      "keep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of the\n",
      "Crucifixion--Golgotha--the Mount of Calvary.  And the last thing he looks\n",
      "at is that which was also the first--the place where the true Cross\n",
      "stood.  That will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more,\n",
      "and once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all\n",
      "interest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I close my chapter on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre--the most\n",

      "infidel pollution.  Even in our own day a war, that cost millions of\n",

      "\n",
      "We were standing in a narrow street, by the Tower of Antonio.  “On these\n",
      "stones that are crumbling away,” the guide said, “the Saviour sat and\n",
      "rested before taking up the cross.  This is the beginning of the\n",
      "Sorrowful Way, or the Way of Grief.”  The party took note of the sacred\n",
      "spot, and moved on.  We passed under the “Ecce Homo Arch,” and saw the\n",
      "very window from which Pilate's wife warned her husband to have nothing\n",
      "to do with the persecution of the Just Man.  This window is in an\n",
      "excellent state of preservation, considering its great age.  They showed\n",
      "us where Jesus rested the second time, and where the mob refused to give\n",
      "him up, and said, “Let his blood be upon our heads, and upon our\n",
      "children's children forever.”  The French Catholics are building a church\n",
      "on this spot, and with their usual veneration for historical relics, are\n",
      "incorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they have\n",
      "found there.  Further on, we saw the spot where the fainting Saviour fell\n",
      "under the weight of his cross.  A great granite column of some ancient\n",
      "temple lay there at the time, and the heavy cross struck it such a blow\n",
      "that it broke in two in the middle.  Such was the guide's story when he\n",
      "halted us before the broken column.\n",
      "\n",
      "We crossed a street, and came presently to the former residence of St.\n",
      "Veronica.  When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of womanly\n",
      "compassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the hootings and\n",
      "the threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from his face\n",
      "with her handkerchief.  We had heard so much of St. Veronica, and seen\n",
      "her picture by so many masters, that it was like meeting an old friend\n",
      "unexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem.  The strangest\n",
      "thing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that when\n",
      "she wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remained\n",
      "upon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day.\n",
      "We knew this, because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris,\n",
      "in another in Spain, and in two others in Italy.  In the Milan cathedral\n",
      "it costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, it is almost\n",
      "impossible to see it at any price.  No tradition is so amply verified as\n",
      "this of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone masonry of\n",
      "the corner of a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it but that the\n",
      "guide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who stumbled here and\n",
      "fell.  Presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall.\n",
      "The guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made this depression with\n",
      "his elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other places where the Lord fell, and others where he rested;\n",
      "but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on this\n",
      "morning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary, was a\n",
      "certain stone built into a house--a stone that was so seamed and scarred\n",
      "that it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face.  The\n",
      "projections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionate\n",
      "kisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands.  We asked “Why?”\n",
      " The guide said it was because this was one of “the very stones of\n",
      "Jerusalem” that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the\n",
      "people to cry “Hosannah!”  when he made his memorable entry into the\n",
      "city upon an ass.  One of the pilgrims said, “But there is no evidence\n",
      "that the stones did cry out--Christ said that if the people stopped from\n",
      "shouting Hosannah, the very stones would do it.”  The guide was perfectly\n",
      "serene.  He said, calmly, “This is one of the stones that would have\n",
      "cried out.” It was of little use to try to shake this fellow's simple\n",
      "faith--it was easy to see that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding interest\n",
      "--the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has been\n",
      "celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years as the\n",
      "Wandering Jew.  On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood in this\n",
      "old doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the struggling mob\n",
      "that was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would have sat down and\n",
      "rested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said, “Move on!”  The\n",
      "Lord said, “Move on, thou, likewise,” and the command has never been\n",
      "revoked from that day to this.  All men know how that the miscreant upon\n",
      "whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the wide world,\n",
      "for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding it--courting death but\n",
      "always in vain--longing to stop, in city, in wilderness, in desert\n",
      "solitudes, yet hearing always that relentless warning to march--march on!\n",
      "They say--do these hoary traditions--that when Titus sacked Jerusalem and\n",
      "slaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in her streets and by-ways, the\n",
      "Wandering Jew was seen always in the thickest of the fight, and that when\n",
      "battle-axes gleamed in the air, he bowed his head beneath them; when\n",
      "swords flashed their deadly lightnings, he sprang in their way; he bared\n",
      "his breast to whizzing javelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to every\n",
      "weapon that promised death and forgetfulness, and rest.  But it was\n",
      "useless--he walked forth out of the carnage without a wound.  And it is\n",
      "said that five hundred years afterward he followed Mahomet when he\n",
      "carried destruction to the cities of Arabia, and then turned against him,\n",
      "hoping in this way to win the death of a traitor.  His calculations were\n",
      "wrong again.  No quarter was given to any living creature but one, and\n",
      "that was the only one of all the host that did not want it.  He sought\n",
      "death five hundred years later, in the wars of the Crusades, and offered\n",
      "himself to famine and pestilence at Ascalon.  He escaped again--he could\n",
      "not die.  These repeated annoyances could have at last but one effect\n",
      "--they shook his confidence.  Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on a\n",
      "kind of desultory toying with the most promising of the aids and\n",
      "implements of destruction, but with small hope, as a general thing.  He\n",
      "has speculated some in cholera and railroads, and has taken almost a\n",
      "lively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines.  He is old,\n",

      "Mohammedans, because that hole leads down to perdition, and every soul\n",
      "that is transferred from thence to Heaven must pass up through this\n",

      "and also the buckler of Mahomet's uncle.  The great iron railing which\n",
      "surrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags tied\n",

      "The donkeys were all good, all handsome, all strong and in good\n",
      "condition, all fast and all willing to prove it.  They were the best we\n",
      "had found any where, and the most 'recherche'.  I do not know what\n",
      "'recherche' is, but that is what these donkeys were, anyhow.  Some\n",
      "were of a soft mouse-color, and the others were white, black, and\n",
      "vari-colored.  Some were close-shaven, all over, except that a tuft like\n",
      "a paint-brush was left on the end of the tail.  Others were so shaven in\n",
      "fanciful landscape garden patterns, as to mark their bodies with curving\n",
      "lines, which were bounded on one side by hair and on the other by the\n",
      "close plush left by the shears.  They had all been newly barbered, and\n",
      "were exceedingly stylish.  Several of the white ones were barred like\n",
      "zebras with rainbow stripes of blue and red and yellow paint.  These\n",
      "were indescribably gorgeous.  Dan and Jack selected from this lot\n",
      "because they brought back Italian reminiscences of the “old masters.”\n",
      " The saddles were the high, stuffy, frog-shaped things we had known in\n",
      "Ephesus and Smyrna.  The donkey-boys were lively young Egyptian rascals\n",
      "who could follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day without\n",
      "tiring.  We had plenty of spectators when we mounted, for the hotel was\n",
      "full of English people bound overland to India and officers getting\n",
      "ready for the African campaign against the Abyssinian King Theodorus.\n",
      "We were not a very large party, but as we charged through the streets of\n",
      "the great metropolis, we made noise for five hundred, and displayed\n",
      "activity and created excitement in proportion.  Nobody can steer a\n",
      "donkey, and some collided with camels, dervishes, effendis, asses,\n",
      "beggars and every thing else that offered to the donkeys a reasonable\n",
      "chance for a collision. When we turned into the broad avenue that leads\n",
      "out of the city toward Old Cairo, there was plenty of room.  The walls\n",
      "of stately date-palms that fenced the gardens and bordered the way,\n",
      "threw their shadows down and made the air cool and bracing.  We rose to\n",
      "the spirit of the time and the race became a wild rout, a stampede, a\n",
      "terrific panic.  I wish to live to enjoy it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere along this route we had a few startling exhibitions of Oriental\n",
      "simplicity.  A girl apparently thirteen years of age came along the great\n",
      "thoroughfare dressed like Eve before the fall.  We would have called her\n",
      "thirteen at home; but here girls who look thirteen are often not more\n",
      "than nine, in reality.  Occasionally we saw stark-naked men of superb\n",
      "build, bathing, and making no attempt at concealment.  However, an hour's\n",
      "acquaintance with this cheerful custom reconciled the pilgrims to it, and\n",
      "then it ceased to occasion remark.  Thus easily do even the most\n",
      "startling novelties grow tame and spiritless to these sight-surfeited\n",
      "wanderers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at Old Cairo, the camp-followers took up the donkeys and tumbled\n",
      "them bodily aboard a small boat with a lateen sail, and we followed and\n",
      "got under way.  The deck was closely packed with donkeys and men; the two\n",
      "sailors had to climb over and under and through the wedged mass to work\n",
      "the sails, and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkeys out of the\n",
      "way when he wished to swing his tiller and put his helm hard-down.  But\n",
      "what were their troubles to us?  We had nothing to do; nothing to do but\n",
      "enjoy the trip; nothing to do but shove the donkeys off our corns and\n",
      "look at the charming scenery of the Nile.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the island at our right was the machine they call the Nilometer, a\n",
      "stone-column whose business it is to mark the rise of the river and\n",
      "prophecy whether it will reach only thirty-two feet and produce a famine,\n",
      "or whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty,\n",
      "or whether it will rise to forty-three and bring death and destruction to\n",
      "flocks and crops--but how it does all this they could not explain to us\n",
      "so that we could understand.  On the same island is still shown the spot\n",
      "where Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes.  Near the spot we\n",
      "sailed from, the Holy Family dwelt when they sojourned in Egypt till\n",
      "Herod should complete his slaughter of the innocents.  The same tree they\n",
      "rested under when they first arrived, was there a short time ago, but the\n",
      "Viceroy of Egypt sent it to the Empress Eugenie lately.  He was just in\n",
      "time, otherwise our pilgrims would have had it.\n",

      "The Nile at this point is muddy, swift and turbid, and does not lack a\n",
      "great deal of being as wide as the Mississippi.\n",
      "\n",
      "We scrambled up the steep bank at the shabby town of Ghizeh, mounted the\n",
      "donkeys again, and scampered away.  For four or five miles the route lay\n",
      "along a high embankment which they say is to be the bed of a railway the\n",
      "Sultan means to build for no other reason than that when the Empress of\n",
      "the French comes to visit him she can go to the Pyramids in comfort.\n",

      "At the distance of a few miles the Pyramids rising above the palms,\n",
      "looked very clean-cut, very grand and imposing, and very soft and filmy,\n",

    "     be selected, in which will be taken a select company, numbering not\n",
    "     more than   three-fourths of the ship's capacity.  There is good\n",
    "     reason to believe that this company can be easily made up in this\n",
    "     immediate vicinity, of mutual friends and acquaintances.\n",

    "     four days.\n",

    "     years before the Christian era, and its artificial port, the finest\n",
    "     of the kind in the Mediterranean, but to visit Paris during the\n",

LDA model looks for repeating term patterns in the entire DT matrix. Python provides many great libraries for text mining practices, “gensim” is one such clean and beautiful library to handle text data. It is scalable, robust and efficient. Following code shows how to convert a corpus into a document-term matrix."
